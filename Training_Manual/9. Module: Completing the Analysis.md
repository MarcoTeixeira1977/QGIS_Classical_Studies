# 9. Module: Completing the Analysis

[Additional eductional material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EqTNZhhCSkmQhYPK7otcpsJOE-glf-Cc?ths=true)

You now have two halves of an analysis: a vector and a raster part. In this module, you’ll see how to combine them. You will conclude the analysis and present the final results.

## 9.1. Lesson: Raster to Vector Conversion
Converting between raster and vector formats allows you to make use of both raster and vector data when solving a GIS problem, as well as using the various analysis methods unique to these two forms of geographic data. This increases the flexibility you have when considering data sources and processing methods for solving a GIS problem.

To combine a raster and vector analysis, you need to convert the one type of data to the other. Let’s convert the raster result of the previous lesson to a vector.

**The goal for this lesson:** To get the raster result into a vector that can be used to complete the analysis.

### 9.1.1. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: The **``Raster to Vector``** Tool

Continue with the map from the last module and add the raster layer _L09_suitable.tif_ or download the exercise data for Module 9. We have created a new raster file using the raster calculator (this is not part of our course, but is available via the QGIS [Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/training_manual/rasters/terrain_analysis.html#moderate-fa-using-the-raster-calculator)).

The **``L09_suitable``** layer has _0_ and _1_ values, where _1_ signifies a pixel located in an area with optimum conditions for farming:

* the slope is less than 20%
* the field is south facing

Now we want to combine these optimal conditions with the solution from Module 6 (you can also find this as _L09_Landuse_Tagili.shp_ in the Module 9 vector exercise data).  

* Click on **``Raster ‣ Conversion ‣ Polygonize (Raster to Vector)``**. The tool dialog will appear.
* Set it up like this:

![9.1.1 A]()

* Change the field name (describing the values of the raster) to **``suitable``**.
* Save the layer under _exercise_data/9.Module_ as _all_terrain.shp_.

Now you have a vector file which contains all the values of the raster, but the only areas you’re interested in are those that are suitable; i.e., those polygons where the value of **``suitable``** is _1_. You can change the style of this layer if you want to have a clearer visualization of it.

### 9.1.2. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself
Refer back to the module on [vector analysis](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/6.%20Module:%20Creating%20Vector%20Data.md).

* Create a new vector file that contains only the polygons where _suitable_ has the value of _1_.
* Save the new file as _exercise_data/9.Module_ as _suitable_terrain.shp_.

### 9.1.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: The **``Vector to Raster``** Tool
Although unnecessary for our current problem, it’s useful to know about the opposite conversion from the one performed above. Convert to raster the _suitable_terrain.shp_ vector file you just created in previous step.

* Click on **``Raster ‣ Conversion ‣ Rasterize (Vector to Raster)``** to start this tool, then set it up as in the screenshot below:

![9.1.3 A]()

* **``Input file``** is **``all_terrain``**.
* **``Output file…``** is ~_exercise_data/residential_development/raster_conversion.tif_~.
* **``Width``** and **``Height``** are ~_837_ and _661_~, respectively.

**``! Note``**
The size of the output image is specified here to be the same as the original raster which was vectorized. To view the dimensions of an image, open its metadata (**``Metadata``** tab in the **``Layer Properties``**).

* Click **``OK``** on the dialog to begin the conversion process.
* When it is complete, gauge its success by comparing the new raster with the original one. They should match up exactly, pixel for pixel.

### 9.1.4. In Conclusion
Converting between raster and vector formats allows you to widen the applicability of data, and need not lead to data degradation.

### 9.1.5. What’s Next?
Now that we have the results of the terrain analysis available in vector format, they can be used to solve the problem of which buildings we should consider for the residential development.

## 9.2. Lesson: Combining the Analyses
Using the vectorized results of the raster analysis will allow you to select only those buildings on suitable terrain.

**The goal for this lesson:** To use the vectorized terrain results to select suitable plots.

### 9.2.1. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself
* Save your current map (raster_analysis.qgs).
* Open the map in which you created during the vector analysis earlier (you should have saved the file as analysis.qgs).
* In the **``Layers``** panel, enable these layers:

> * **``hillshade``**,
> * **``solution``**

* In addition to these layers, which should already be loaded in the map from when you worked on it before, also add the _suitable_terrain.shp_ dataset.
* If you are missing some layers, you should find them in _exercise_data/9.Module_
* Use the **``Intersect``** tool (**``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools``**) to create a new vector layer called new_solution.shp which contains only those buildings which intersect the suitable_terrain layer.

You should now have a layer showing certain ~buildings~ as your solution, for example:

![9.2.1 A]()

**``! Note``**
If you find that the **``Intersect``** tool does not produce any results, check the CRS settings of each of your layers. The CRS must be the same for both the layers you are comparing. You may need to reproject one layer by saving the layer as a new file with the required CRS. In our example, the suitable_terrain layer was reprojected to WGS 84 / UTM 34S and named suitable_terrain_34S.shp.

### 9.2.2. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Inspecting the Results
Look at each of the buildings in your **``new_solution``** layer. Compare them with the **``suitable_terrain``** layer by changing the symbology for the **``new_solution``** layer so that it has outlines only. What do you notice about some of the buildings? Are they all suitable just because they intersect with the **``suitable_terrain``** layer? Why or why not? Which ones would you deem to be unsuitable?

[Check your results]()

### 9.2.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Refining the Analysis
You can see from the results that some buildings which were included were not really suitable, so we can now refine the analysis.

We want to ensure that our analysis returns only those buildings which fall entirely within the suitable_terrain layer. How would you achieve this? Use one or more Vector Analysis tools and remember that our buildings are all over 100m squared in size.

[Check your results]()

### 9.2.4. In Conclusion
You have now answered the original research question, and can offer an opinion (with reasons, backed by analysis) for a recommendation regarding which property to develop.

### 9.2.5. What’s Next?
~Next you will present these results as part of your second assignment.~

## 9.3. Assignment
Using the print layout, make a new map representing the results of your analysis. Include these layers:

* **``places``** (with labels),
* **``hillshade``**,
* **``solution``** (or **``new_solution``**),
* **``roads``** and
* either **``aerial_photos``** or **``DEM``**.

Write a short explanatory text to accompany it. Include in this text the criteria that were used in considering a house for purchase and subsequent development, as well as explaining your recommendations for which buildings are suitable.
