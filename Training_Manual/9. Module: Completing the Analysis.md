# 9. Module: Completing the Analysis
You now have two halves of an analysis: a vector and a raster part. In this module, you’ll see how to combine them. You will conclude the analysis and present the final results.

## 9.1. Lesson: Raster to Vector Conversion
Converting between raster and vector formats allows you to make use of both raster and vector data when solving a GIS problem, as well as using the various analysis methods unique to these two forms of geographic data. This increases the flexibility you have when considering data sources and processing methods for solving a GIS problem.

To combine a raster and vector analysis, you need to convert the one type of data to the other. Let’s convert the raster result of the previous lesson to a vector.

**The goal for this lesson:** To get the raster result into a vector that can be used to complete the analysis.

### 9.1.1. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: The Raster to Vector Tool
Start with the map from the last module, raster_analysis.qgs. There you should have the all_conditions_simple.tif calculated during the previous exercises.

Click on Raster ‣ Conversion ‣ Polygonize (Raster to Vector). The tool dialog will appear.

Set it up like this:

![9.1.1 A]()

Change the field name (describing the values of the raster) to suitable.

Save the layer under exercise_data/residential_development as all_terrain.shp.

Now you have a vector file which contains all the values of the raster, but the only areas you’re interested in are those that are suitable; i.e., those polygons where the value of suitable is 1. You can change the style of this layer if you want to have a clearer visualization of it.

### 9.1.2. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself
Refer back to the module on vector analysis.

Create a new vector file that contains only the polygons where suitable has the value of 1.

Save the new file as exercise_data/residential_development/ as suitable_terrain.shp.

[Check your results]()

### 9.1.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: The Vector to Raster Tool
Although unnecessary for our current problem, it’s useful to know about the opposite conversion from the one performed above. Convert to raster the suitable_terrain.shp vector file you just created in previous step.

Click on Raster ‣ Conversion ‣ Rasterize (Vector to Raster) to start this tool, then set it up as in the screenshot below:

![9.1.3 A]()

Input file is all_terrain.

Output file… is exercise_data/residential_development/raster_conversion.tif.

Width and Height are 837 and 661, respectively.

**``! Note``**
The size of the output image is specified here to be the same as the original raster which was vectorized. To view the dimensions of an image, open its metadata (Metadata tab in the Layer Properties).

Click OK on the dialog to begin the conversion process.

When it is complete, gauge its success by comparing the new raster with the original one. They should match up exactly, pixel for pixel.

### 9.1.4. In Conclusion
Converting between raster and vector formats allows you to widen the applicability of data, and need not lead to data degradation.

### 9.1.5. What’s Next?
Now that we have the results of the terrain analysis available in vector format, they can be used to solve the problem of which buildings we should consider for the residential development.

## 9.2. Lesson: Combining the Analyses
Using the vectorized results of the raster analysis will allow you to select only those buildings on suitable terrain.

The goal for this lesson: To use the vectorized terrain results to select suitable plots.

### 9.2.1. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself
Save your current map (raster_analysis.qgs).

Open the map in which you created during the vector analysis earlier (you should have saved the file as analysis.qgs).

In the Layers panel, enable these layers:

hillshade,

solution (or buildings_over_100)

In addition to these layers, which should already be loaded in the map from when you worked on it before, also add the suitable_terrain.shp dataset.

If you are missing some layers, you should find them in exercise_data/residential_development/

Use the Intersect tool (Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools) to create a new vector layer called new_solution.shp which contains only those buildings which intersect the suitable_terrain layer.

You should now have a layer showing certain buildings as your solution, for example:

![9.2.1 A]()

**``! Note``**
If you find that the Intersect tool does not produce any results, check the CRS settings of each of your layers. The CRS must be the same for both the layers you are comparing. You may need to reproject one layer by saving the layer as a new file with the required CRS. In our example, the suitable_terrain layer was reprojected to WGS 84 / UTM 34S and named suitable_terrain_34S.shp.

### 9.2.2. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Inspecting the Results
Look at each of the buildings in your new_solution layer. Compare them with the suitable_terrain layer by changing the symbology for the new_solution layer so that it has outlines only. What do you notice about some of the buildings? Are they all suitable just because they intersect with the suitable_terrain layer? Why or why not? Which ones would you deem to be unsuitable?

[Check your results]()

### 9.2.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Refining the Analysis
You can see from the results that some buildings which were included were not really suitable, so we can now refine the analysis.

We want to ensure that our analysis returns only those buildings which fall entirely within the suitable_terrain layer. How would you achieve this? Use one or more Vector Analysis tools and remember that our buildings are all over 100m squared in size.

[Check your results]()

### 9.2.4. In Conclusion
You have now answered the original research question, and can offer an opinion (with reasons, backed by analysis) for a recommendation regarding which property to develop.

### 9.2.5. What’s Next?
~Next you will present these results as part of your second assignment.~

## 9.3. Assignment
Using the print layout, make a new map representing the results of your analysis. Include these layers:

* **``places``** (with labels),
* **``hillshade``**,
* **``solution``** (or **``new_solution``**),
* **``roads``** and
* either **``aerial_photos``** or **``DEM``**.

Write a short explanatory text to accompany it. Include in this text the criteria that were used in considering a house for purchase and subsequent development, as well as explaining your recommendations for which buildings are suitable.
