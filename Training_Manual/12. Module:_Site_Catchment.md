## 12.1. Lesson: Combining Tools
In this lesson we will perform a basic site catchment analysis by combining different QGIS tools. We will therefore focus on just one surveyed area: the upper Almanzora valley in Roman times. You can expand the analysis by adding more areas/times of course. Needed data for every region is available at IGN (see data source information).

**The goal for this lesson:** Learn to combine different tools to perform analysis.

**``! Note``** 
We will work with temporary layers during this module. If you want to do these lessons not at once, please make sure you make the temporary permament by right clicking it and choose either **``Make Permanent``** or **``Export ‣ Save Features As...``**. Otherwise you temporary layers will not be usable after closing QGIS and you have to to the previous steps again.
 

### 12.1.1. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Buffering
For a catchment analysis of our settlements, we will need the following layers: _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_, _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_. As you learned within the additional material, there are different ways of performing such an analysis. We will you use the simple way of calculating an area of 2km surrounding each settlement. 
Therefore open **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Buffer``** and choose _**L12_AnArqAnd_SurveyAlmanzora.shp**_ as *Input layer*, a *Distance* of **2.0** (and don’t forget to set the scale to **kilometers**!) and *Segments* to **20**. You should now get something like this:

### 12.1.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Refine catchment area
Now we want to subtract rivers from our estimated territories, because they are not useable for agriculture. To do that, use **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Difference``** and choose your temporary _**Buffered layer**_ as *Input layer* and _**L12_BTN25_RiversAlmanzora.shp**_ as *Overlay layer*. 

**``! Note``** The process might take a while, depending of your computer's speed. 

We determined all land within 2 kilometres around every settlement now. To get an idea of what may have been cultivated in that area, we will now combine that with the modern land use layer from Corine Land Cover. To do so, use **``Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣ Intersection``**. Define the temporary _**Difference**_ layer as *Input layer* and the _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_ as *Overlay layer*. To get a better optical effect, we will now copy the layer style of _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_ and paste it to our _**Intersection**_ layer. Layer and attribute table should now look like this:

### 12.1.3. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Requesting information

**``! Note``** The attribute tables holds information from the combined layers now. So you have many polygons for one settlement represent the different landcover-polygons.

Last we will calculate the covered area of every polygon. The attribute table already has a column called *AREA_HA*, but the numbers are from the original _**L12_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora.shp**_ layer. 
Make your layer editable, open the **``Raster Calculator``**, mark **``Update existing field``** and choose *AREA_HA*. Now search for *Geometry* and double click *$area* within the given list. This will calculate the area in square metres. Since our column is called *AREA_HA*, we should provide the numbers in hectare. Therefore, add */10000* to the Expression. You should now have a formula like this within it:
 
![12.1.3 A Calculator](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/12.1.3%20A%20Calculator.png) 

After clicking **``OK``**, your *AREA_HA* column should have been updated und you can save your _**Intersection**_ layer as your final _**Catchment Area**_ layer. 

**``! Note``** To perform a real catchment analysis, you have of course to use as much data as possible. Additionally we used modern land-use information. That is of course not showing ancient environment, but should explain, how the analysis is performed in QGIS. Determine an ancient environment is too complex to explain here in detail. If you would like to know more, please follow the given information within the additional learning material. 

### 8.3.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Calculating the Slope
Another useful thing to know about the terrain is how steep it is. If, for example, you want to build houses on the land there, then you need land that is relatively flat.

To do this, you need to use the **``Slope``** algorithm of the **``Processing ‣ Raster terrain analysis``**.

1. Open the algorithm
2. Choose ~**``srtm_41_19``**~ as the **``Elevation layer``**
3. Save the output as a file with the name _slope_ in the same folder as the _hillshade_
4. Click on **``Run``**

Now you’ll see the slope of the terrain, with black pixels being flat terrain and white pixels, steep terrain:

### 7.3.4. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Calculating the aspect
Aspect is the compass direction that the slope of the terrain faces. An aspect of 0 means that the slope is North-facing, 90 East-facing, 180 South-facing, and 270 West-facing.

Since this study is taking place in the Southern Hemisphere, properties should ideally be built on a north-facing slope so that they can remain in the sunlight.

Use the Aspect algorithm of the Processing ‣ Raster terrain analysis to get the layer.

Check your results

### 12.1.4. In Conclusion
You have combined different QGIS included processes to perform a basic catchment analysis, which is used widely in different archaeological studies (mostly in a more complex form of course).

### 12.1.5. What’s Next?
Congratulations, you finished the course! We hope you enjoyed these basic modules and you learned something about using QGIS in classical studies. Feel free to repeat some of the lessons with more data or even with your own project. The easiest way to learn QGIS is using it!
