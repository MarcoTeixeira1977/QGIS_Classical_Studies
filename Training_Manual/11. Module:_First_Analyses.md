# 11. First Analyses 
We will be using some of the digitized survey maps from AnArQAnd and their inherited information. We combine roman settlements from the surveys with already known roman cities from the Pleiades data, to analyse possible territories and dependencies of cities and rural settlements. The analysis of this dataset is pretty obvious and there is no need for sophisticated GIS techniques to end up with good results and conclusions, but it is a good way of showing how these spatial problems can be analyzed and solved by using different processing tools.
The dataset contains shapefiles with roman settlements and cities, and shapefile with the boundaries of the Iberian Peninsula. Open the layers **L11_AnArqAnd_rSettlements.shp**, **L11_AWMC_rCities.shp** and **L11_NED_boundariesIP.shp**.
 

### 11.1.1. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Voronoi polygons
The first thing to do is to calculting the Voronoi diagram (a.k.a. Thiessen polygons) of Roman cities, to get an idea of which territory might be claimed by each of them. The Voronoi Diagram algorithm can be used for that.
 

Open **Vector ‣ Geometry Tools ‣ Voronoi Polygons**. Choose the **L11_AWMC_rCities.shp** und just click **Run**. Your result should look like this:

What you will realize is that every point has its corresponding polygon now. But, if you have a look at the coastline, the polygons don’t respect landmasses. Instead they are drawn till the edges of the cities layer’s extent. That’s understandable, but not very helpful. To get a more “realistic” impression, we will now cut the polygons with the border of the Iberian Peninsula.
Therefore, load the layer **L11_NED_boundariesIP.shp**. Now you navigate to **Vector ‣ Geprocessing Tools ‣ Clip** and set your Voronoi polygons as Input layer and the **L11_NED_boundariesIP.shp** layer as *Overlay Layer* und **Run** the algorithm. Now your Voronoi Polygons should only cover landmass. You can now save your temporary layer.
Now load the **L11_AnArqAnd_rSettlements.shp** layer which includes some digitized roman settlements from our survey articles.

To get a more quantitative result, we can count the number of settlements in each polygon now. Therefore open **Vector ‣ Analysis Tools ‣ Count Points in Polygon**, set your **Voronoi** as *Polygons*, **L11_AWMC_rCities.shp** as *Points* and click *Run*.
 

### 11.1.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png)  Follow Along: Calculating distance 

Another way of visualizing the dependence of each point in the **L11_AnArqAnd_rSettlements.shp** layer with a point in the **L11_AWMC_rCities.shp** layer is to draw a line to the closest one. This can be done with the *Distance to nearest hub* tool in **Processing ‣ Toolbox ‣ Vector Analysis**, and using the configuration shown next.

The result looks like this:

### 10.1.4. In Conclusion
You have now learned to execute easy analyzation methods for archaeological data by using QGIS integrated processes.

### 10.1.5. What’s Next?
In the next lesson, you will combine some QGIS tools to execute combined analysis to get more information from our survey data.
