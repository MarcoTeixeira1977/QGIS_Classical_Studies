## 11.1 Lesson: Performing easy Spatial Analyses
We will be using some of the digitized survey maps from AnArqAnd and their inherited information. We combine Roman settlements from the surveys with already known Roman cities from the ERC-project "An Empire of 2000 Cities" (E2KC), to analyse possible territories and dependencies of cities and rural settlements. The analysis of this dataset is pretty obvious and there is no need for sophisticated GIS techniques to end up with good results and conclusions, but it is a good way of showing how these spatial problems can be analyzed and solved by using different processing tools.
The dataset contains shapefiles with roman settlements and cities, and shapefile with the boundaries of the Iberian Peninsula. Open the layers **_L11_AnArqAnd_rSettlements.shp_**, **_L11_E2KC_Cities.shp_** and **_L11_NED_boundariesIP.shp_**.

**The goal for this lesson:** Perform your first spatial analyses.
 

### 11.1.1. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Voronoi polygons
The first thing to do is to calculting the Voronoi diagram (a.k.a. Thiessen polygons) of Roman cities, to get an idea of which territory might be claimed by each of them. The Voronoi Diagram algorithm can be used for that.

Open **``Vector ‣ Geometry Tools ‣ Voronoi Polygons``**. Choose the **_L11_E2KC_Cities.shp_**, an *Buffer Region* of **10** (that helps to cover the whole landmass even at borders where no city is located. You can try without any buffer to see the difference)  just click **``Run``**. Your result should look like this:

What you will realize is that every point has its corresponding polygon now. But, if you have a look at the coastline, the polygons don’t respect landmasses. Instead they are drawn till the edges of the cities layer’s extent. That’s understandable, but not very helpful. To get a more “realistic” impression, we will now cut the polygons using the limitations of the Iberian Peninsula.
Make sure the layer **_L11_NED_boundariesIP.shp_** is loaded and active. Now you navigate to **Vector ‣ Geprocessing Tools ‣ Clip** and set your Voronoi polygons as *Input layer* and the **_L11_NED_boundariesIP.shp_** layer as *Overlay Layer* und **Run** the algorithm. As a result your Voronoi Polygons should only cover landmass. You can now save your temporary layer. (If that doesn't work, you can load **_L11_TOL_Voronoi.shp_** and work with the already prepared Voronoi layer).

Next load the **_L11_AnArqAnd_rSettlements.shp_** layer which includes some digitized roman settlements from our survey articles.

To get a more quantitative result, we can count the number of settlements in each polygon. Therefore open **``Vector ‣ Analysis Tools ‣ Count Points in Polygon``**, set your **Voronoi** as *Polygons*, **_L11_AnArqAnd_rSettlements.shp_** as *Points* and click **``Run``**. You will now get a new layer similar to your Voronoi layer. However, in the attribute table you will see an additional column named NUMPOINTS. If you check the city of Tagili now, it will tell you, that 35 roman settlements are located within Tagili's territory.
 
### 11.1.2. ![Basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png)  Follow Along: Calculating distance 

Another way of visualizing the dependence of each point in the **_L11_AnArqAnd_rSettlements.shp_** layer with a point in the **_L11_E2KC_Cities.shp_** layer is to draw a line to the closest one. This can be done with the **``Distance to Nearest Hub (Line to Hub)``** tool in **``Processing ‣ Toolbox ‣ Vector Analysis``**, and using the configuration shown next.

![11.1.2 A Settings](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/11.1.2%20A%20Settings.png)
 
The result looks like this:

![11.1.2 B Hub Distance](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/11.1.2%20B%20Hub%20Distance.png)

Similiar to Voronoi, the algorithm has connected every roman settlement to the nearest point from the cities layer. So lines indicate to which city's territory the settlement might have been assignend. Additionally the attribute table shows you the distance in meters between settlement and city.  

### 11.1.4. In Conclusion
You have now learned to execute easy analyzation methods for archaeological data by using QGIS integrated processes.

### 11.1.5. What’s Next?
In the next lesson, you will combine some QGIS tools to execute combined analysis to get more information from our survey data.
