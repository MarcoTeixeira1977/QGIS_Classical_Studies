# 7. Module: Vector Analysis
Now that you have edited a few features, you must want to know what else one can do with them. Having features with attributes is nice, but when all is said and done, this doesn’t really tell you anything that a normal, non-GIS map can’t.

The key advantage of a GIS is this: _a GIS can answer questions_.

For the next three modules, we’ll endeavor to answer a _research question_ using GIS functions. For example, you are interested in the possible locations for villae with the following criteria:

~~1. They are within roughly 3h walking (15 km) from a city.~
2. They must be .
~~3. It must be more than 100m squared in size.
4. Closer than 50m to a main road.
~~5. Closer than 500m to a restaurant.~~

Within the next few modules, we’ll harness the power of GIS analysis tools to locate suitable farm properties for this new residential development.

## 7.1. Lesson: Reprojecting and Transforming Data
Let us talk about Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) again. We have touched on this briefly before, but haven’t discussed what it means practically.

**The goal for this lesson:** To reproject and transform vector datasets.

### 7.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Projections
The CRS that all the data, as well as the map itself are in right now is called WGS84. This is a very common Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) for representing data. But there’s a problem, as we will see.

1. Open a new project
2. Then type _world_ in the **``Coordinate``** field, which is in the _Statusbar_ along the bottom of the screen. A **``World Map``** Layer will be added to the empty project.
4. Zoom in to Spain by using the Zoom In tool
5. Try setting a scale in the **``Scale``** field, which is in the _Statusbar_ next to the **``Coordinate``** field the bottom of the screen. While over Spain, set this value to _1:5 000 000_ (one to five million).
6. Pan around the map while keeping an eye on the Scale field

Notice the scale changing? That’s because you are moving away from the one point that you zoomed into at _1:6 000 000_, which was at the center of your screen. All around that point, the scale is different.

To understand why, think about a globe of the Earth. It has lines running along it from North to South. These longitude lines are far apart at the equator, but they meet at the poles.

In a GCS, you are working on this sphere, but your screen is flat. When you try to represent the sphere on a flat surface, distortion occurs, similar to what would happen if you cut open a tennis ball and tried to flatten it out. What this means on a map is that the longitude lines stay equally far apart from each other, even at the poles (where they are supposed to meet). This means that, as you travel away from the equator on your map, the scale of the objects that you see gets larger and larger. What this means for us, practically, is that there is no constant scale on our map!

To solve this, let’s use a Projected Coordinate System (PCS) instead. A PCS “projects” or converts the data in a way that makes allowance for the scale change and corrects it. Therefore, to keep the scale constant, we should reproject our data to use a PCS.

### 7.1.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: “On the Fly” Reprojection
By default, QGIS reprojects data “on the fly”. What this means is that even if the data itself is in another CRS, QGIS can project it as if it were in a CRS of your choice.

You can change the CRS of the project by clicking on the ![projectionEnabled](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mIconProjectionEnabled.png)_Current projection_ button in the bottom right corner of QGIS.

1. In the dialog that appears, type the word _global_ into the **``Filter``** field. A few CRSs should appear in the **``Predefined Reference Systems``** field below.
2. Select EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N entry by clicking on it, and then click **``OK``**.
   Notice how the shape of Spain (and the whole world) changes. All projections work by changing the apparent shapes of objects on Earth.
3. Zoom to a scale of _1:6 000 000_ again, as before.
4. Pan around the map.

Notice how the scale stays the same!

“On the fly” reprojection is also used for combining datasets that are in different CRSs.

1. Add another vector layer to your map which has the data for Spain only. You will find it as _exercise_data/world/RSA.shp_.
2. Load it. A quick way to see its CRS is by hovering the mouse over the layer in the legend. It is ~_EPSG:3410_~.
   What do you notice?

The layer is visible even if it has a different CRS from the **``World Map``** one.

### 7.1.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Saving a Dataset to Another CRS
Sometimes you need to export an existing dataset with another CRS. As we will see in the next lesson, if you need to make distance calculations on layer, it is always better to have the layer in a projected coordinate system.

Be aware that the ‘on the fly’ reprojection is related to the **project** and not to single layers. This means that a layer can have a different CRS from the project even if you see it in the correct position.

You can easily export the layer with another CRS.

1. Add the ~_buildings_~ dataset from ~_training_data.gpkg_~
2. Right-click on the ~_buildings_~ layer in the **``Layers``** panel
3. Select **``Export ‣ Save Features As…``** in the menu that appears. You will be shown the **``Save Vector Layer as…``** dialog.
4. Click on the **``Browse``** button next to the **``File name``** field
5. Navigate to _exercise_data/_ and specify the name of the new layer as ~_buildings_reprojected.shp_~.
6. Change the value of the **``CRS``**. Only the recent CRSs used will be shown in the drop-down menu. Click on the ![setProjection](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionSetProjection.png)_Select projection_ button next to the drop-down menu.
7. The **``Coordinate Reference System Selector``** dialog will appear. In its **``Filter``** field, search for ~_30N_~.
8. Select **``EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N``** from the list

![7.1.3 A]()

9. Leave the other options unchanged. The **``Save Vector Layer as…``** dialog now looks like this:

![7.1.3 B]()

10. Click **``OK``**

You can now compare the old and new projections of the layer and see that they are in two different CRS but they are still overlapping.

### 7.1.4. In Conclusion
Different projections are useful for different purposes. By choosing the correct projection, you can ensure that the features on your map are being represented accurately.

### 7.1.6. Further Reading
Materials for the Advanced section of this lesson were taken from [this article](https://anitagraser.com/2012/03/18/beautiful-global-projections-adding-custom-projections-to-qgis/).

Further information on Coordinate Reference Systems is available [here](https://linfiniti.com/dla/worksheets/7_CRS.pdf).

### 7.1.7. What’s Next?
In the next lesson you will learn how to analyze vector data using QGIS’ various vector analysis tools.

## 7.2. Lesson: Vector Analysis
Vector data can also be analyzed to reveal how different features interact with each other in space. There are many different analysis-related functions, so we won’t go through them all. Rather, we will pose a question and try to solve it using the tools that QGIS provides.

**The goal for this lesson:** To ask a question and solve it using analysis tools.

### 7.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The GIS Process
Before we start, it would be useful to give a brief overview of a process that can be used to solve a problem. The way to go about it is:

1. State the Problem
2. Get the Data
3. Analyze the Problem
4. Present the Results

### 7.2.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The Problem
Let’s start off the process by deciding on a problem to solve. For example, you are an ~estate agent~ and you are looking for a ~residential property in Swellendam for clients who have the following criteria~:

~1. It needs to be in Swellendam~
~2. It must be within reasonable driving distance of a school (say 1km)~
~3. It must be more than 100m squared in size~
~4. Closer than 50m to a main road~
~5. Closer than 500m to a restaurant~

### 7.2.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The Data
To answer these questions, we are going to need the following data:

~1. The residential properties (buildings) in the area~
~2. The roads in and around the town~
~3. The location of schools and restaurants~
~4. The size of buildings~

These data are available through OSM, and you should find that the dataset you have been using throughout this manual also can be used for this lesson.

If you want to download data from another area, jump to the [Introduction Chapter](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/1.%20Course%20Introduction.md) to read how to do it.

**``! Note``**
Although OSM downloads have consistent data fields, the coverage and detail does vary. If you find that your chosen region does not contain information on restaurants, for example, you may need to chose a different region.

### 7.2.4. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Start a Project and get the Data
We first need to load the data to work with.

1. Start a new QGIS project
2. If you want, you can add a background map. Open the **``Browser``** and load the ~**``OSM``**~ background map from the ~**``XYZ Tiles menu.``**~

![7.2.4 A]()

3. In the ~_training_data.gpkg_~ Geopackage database, you will find most the datasets we will use in this chapter:

   1. ~buildings~
   2. roads
   3. ~restaurants~
   4. ~schools~

Load them, and also ~_landuse.sqlite_~.

4. Zoom to the layer extent to see Swellendam, South Africa

Before proceeding we will filter the **``roads layer``**, in order to have only some specific road types to work with.

Some roads in OSM datasets are listed as ~_unclassified_, _tracks_, _path_ and _footway_~. We want to exclude these from our dataset and focus on the other road types, more suitable for this exercise.

Moreover, OSM data might not be updated everywhere, and we will also exclude _NULL_ values.
5. Right click on the _roads_ layer and choose **``Filter…``**.

6. In the dialog that pops up we filter these features with the following expression:

`` "highway" NOT IN ('footway', 'path', 'unclassified', 'track') AND "highway" != NULL`` 

The concatenation of the two operators _NOT_ and _IN_ excludes all the features that have these attribute values in the ~_highway_~ field.

_!= NULL_ combined with the _AND_ operator excludes roads with no value in the ~_highway_~ field.

Note the ![indicatorFilter](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mIndicatorFilter.png) icon next to the roads layer. It helps you remember that this layer has a filter activated, so some features may not be available in the project.

The map with all the data should look like the following one:

![7.2.4 B]()

### 7.2.5. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself Convert Layers’ CRS
Because we are going to be measuring distances within our layers, we need to change the layers’ CRS. To do this, we need to select each layer in turn, save the layer to a new one with our new projection, then import that new layer into our map.

You have many different options, e.g. you can export each layer as an ESRI Shapefile format dataset, you can append the layers to an existing GeoPackage file, or you can create another GeoPackage file and fill it with the new reprojected layers. We will show the last option, so the _training_data.gpkg_ will remain clean. Feel free to choose the best workflow for yourself.

**``! Note``**
In this example, we are using the EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N. When working with other regions you should use a UTM CRS which is more appropriate for your region.

1. Right click the **``roads``** layer in the **``Layers``** panel
2. Click **``Export –> Save Features As…``**
3. In the **``Save Vector Layer As``** dialog choose **``GeoPackage``** as **``Format``**
4. Click on **``…``** for the **``File name``**, and name the new GeoPackage _vector_analysis_
5. Change the **``Layer name``** to _roads_30N_
6. Change the **``CRS``** to _EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N_
7. Click on **``OK``**:

![7.2.5 A]()

This will create the new GeoPackage database and add the _roads_30N_ layer.
8. Repeat this process for each layer, creating a new layer in the _vector_analysis.gpkg_ GeoPackage file with \_30N appended to the original name and removing each of the old layers from the project.

**``! Note``**
When you choose to save a layer to an existing GeoPackage, QGIS will **append** that layer to the GeoPackage.

9. Once you have completed the process for all the layers, right click on any layer and click **``Zoom to layer extent``** to focus the map to the area of interest.

Now that we have converted OSM data to a UTM projection, we can begin our calculations.

### 7.2.6. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Analyzing the Problem: ~Distances From Schools and Roads~
QGIS allows you to calculate distances between any vector object.

1. Make sure that only the _roads_30N_ and _cities_30N_ layers are visible (to simplify the map while you’re working)
2. Click on the **``Processing ‣ Toolbox``** to open the analytical core of QGIS. Basically, all algorithms (for vector and raster analysis) are available in this toolbox.
3. We start by calculating the area around the _roads_30N_ by using the **``Buffer``** algorithm. You can find it in the **``Vector Geometry``** group.

![7.2.6 A]()

Or you can type _buffer_ in the search menu in the upper part of the toolbox:

![7.2.6 B]()

4. Double click on it to open the algorithm dialog
5. Select _roads_30N_ as **``Input layer``**, set **``Distance``** to 50 and use the default values for the rest of the parameters.

![7.2.6 C]()
The default Distance is in meters because our input dataset is in a Projected Coordinate System that uses meter as its basic measurement unit. You can use the combo box to choose other projected units like kilometers, yards, etc.

**``! Note``** 
If you are trying to make a buffer on a layer with a Geographical Coordinate System, Processing will warn you and suggest to reproject the layer to a metric Coordinate System.

7. By default, _Processing_ creates temporary layers and adds them to the **``Layers``** panel. You can also append the result to the GeoPackage database by:

1. Clicking on the **``…``** button and choose **``Save to GeoPackage…``**
2. Naming the new layer _roads_buffer_50m_
3. Saving it in the _vector_analysis.gpkg_ file

![7.2.6 D]()

Click on **``Run``**, and then close the **``Buffer``** dialog

Now your map will look something like this:

![7.2.6 E]()

If your new layer is at the top of the **``Layers``** list, it will probably obscure much of your map, but this gives you all the areas in your region which are within 50m of a road.

Notice that there are distinct areas within your buffer, which correspond to each individual road. To get rid of this problem:

1. Uncheck the **``roads_buffer_50m``** layer and re-create the buffer with **``Dissolve results``** enabled.

![7.2.6 F]()

2. Save the output as **``roads_buffer_50m_dissolved``**
3. Click **``Run``** and close the **``Buffer``** dialog

Once you have added the layer to the **``Layers``** panel, it will look like this:
![7.2.6 G]()

Now there are no unnecessary subdivisions.

**``! Note``**
The _Short Help_ on the right side of the dialog explains how the algorithm works. If you need more information, just click on the **``Help``** button in the bottom part to open a more detailed guide of the algorithm.

### 7.2.7. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself Distance from cities
Use the same approach as above and create a buffer for your cities.

It shall to be _1 km_ in radius. Save the new layer in the _vector_analysis.gpkg_ file as _cities_buffer_1km_dissolved_.

[Check your results](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/Answer_Sheet/Answer_sheet.md#727--try-yourself-distance-from-cities)

### 7.2.8. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Overlapping Areas
Now we have identified areas where the road is less than 50 meters away and areas where there is a city within 1 km (direct line, not by road). But obviously, we only want the areas where both of these criteria are satisfied. To do that, we will need to use the **``Intersect tool``**. You can find it in **``Vector Overlay``** group in the **``Processing Toolbox``**.

1. Use the two buffer layers as **``Input layer``** and **``Overlay layer``**, choose _vector_analysis.gpkg_ GeoPackage in **``Intersection``** with **``Label name``** _road_school_buffers_intersect_. Leave the rest as suggested (default).

![7.2.8 A]()

2. Click **``Run``**.

In the image below, the blue areas are where both of the distance criteria are satisfied.

![7.2.8 B]()

3. You may remove the two buffer layers and only keep the one that shows where they overlap, since that’s what we really wanted to know in the first place:

![7.2.8 C]()

### 7.2.9. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Extract the Buildings
Now you’ve got the area that the buildings must overlap. Next, you want to extract the buildings in that area.

1. Look for the menu entry **``Vector Selection ‣ Extract by location``** within the _Processing Toolbox_
2. Select ~_buildings_34S_~ in **``Extract features from``**. Check **``intersect``** in **``Where the features (geometric predicate)``**, select the buffer intersection layer in **``By comparing to the features from``**. Save to the _vector_analysis.gpkg_, and name the layer ~_well_located_houses_~.

![7.2.9 A]()

3. Click **``Run``** and close the dialog
4. You will probably find that not much seems to have changed. If so, move the ~**``well_located_houses``**~ layer to the top of the layers list, then zoom in.

![7.2.9 B]()

The red buildings are those which match our criteria, while the buildings in green are those which do not.

Now you have two separated layers and can remove buildings_34S from the layer list.

### 7.2.10. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Further Filter
We now have a layer which shows us all the buildings within 1km of a school and within 50m of a road. We now need to reduce that selection to only show buildings which are within 500m of a restaurant.

Using the processes described above, create a new layer called houses_restaurants_500m which further filters your well_located_houses layer to show only those which are within 500m of a restaurant.

[Check your results]()

### 7.2.11. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Select Buildings of the Right Size
To see which buildings are of the correct size (more than 100 square meters), we need to calculate their size.

1. Select the ~**``houses_restaurants_500m``** layer and open the _Field Calculator_ by clicking on the ![calculateField](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionCalculateField.png)_Open Field Calculator_ button in the main toolbar or in the attribute table window
2. Select **``Create a new field``**, set the **``Output field name``** to _AREA_, choose **``Decimal number (real)``** as **``Output field type``**, and choose _$area_ from the **``Geometry``** group.

![7.2.11 A]()

The new field _AREA_ will contain the area of each building in square meters.
3. Click **``OK``**. The _AREA field_ has been added at the end of the attribute table.
4. Click the ![toggleEditing](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionToggleEditing.png)_Toggle Editing_ button to finish editing, and save your edits when prompted.
5. In the **``Source``** tab of the layer properties, set the **``Provider Feature Filter``** to _"AREA >= 100_.

![7.2.11 B]()

Click OK.

Your map should now only show you those buildings which match our starting criteria and which are more than ~100 square meters~ in size.

### 7.2.12. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
Save your solution as a new layer, using the approach you learned above for doing so. The file should be saved within the same GeoPackage database, with the name _solution_.

### 7.2.13. In Conclusion
Using the GIS problem solving approach together with QGIS vector analysis tools, you were able to solve a problem with multiple criteria quickly and easily.

### 7.2.14. What’s Next?
In the next lesson, we will look at how to calculate the shortest distance along roads from one point to another.

## 7.3. Lesson: Network Analysis
Calculating the shortest distance between two points is a common GIS task. Tools for this can be found in the **``Processing Toolbox``**.

The goal for this lesson: learn to use **``Network analysis``** algorithms.

### 7.3.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: The Tools and the Data
You can find all the network analysis algorithms in the **``Processing ‣ Network Analysis``** menu. You can see that there are many tools available:

![7.3.1 A]()

Open the project  _exercise_data/network_analysis/network.qgz._~ It contains two layers:

* _network_points_
* _network_lines_

The **``network_lines``** layer has already a style that helps to understand the road network.

![7.3.1 B]()

The shortest path tools provide ways to calculate either the shortest or the fastest path between two points of a network, given:

* start and end points selected on the map
* start point selected on the map and end points taken from a point layer
* start points taken from a point layer and end point selected on the map

Let’s start.

### 7.3.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Calculate the shortest path (point to point)
The **``Network analysis ‣ Shortest path (point to point)``** allows you to calculate the shortest distance between two manually selected points on the map.

In this example we will calculate the shortest (not fastest) path between two points.

1. Open the **``Shortest path (point to point)``** algorithm
2. Select **``network_lines``** for **``Vector layer representing network``**
3. Use _Shortest_ for **``Path type to calculate``**

Use these two points as starting and ending points for the analysis:

![7.3.2 A]()

4. Click on the **``…``** button next to **``Start point (x, y)``** and choose the location tagged with _Starting Point_ in the picture. The coordinates of the clicked point are added.
5. Do the same thing, but choosing the location tagged with _Ending point_ for **``End point (x, y)``**
6. Click on the **``Run``** button:

![7.3.2 B]()

7. A new line layer is created representing the shortest path between the chosen points. Uncheck the _network_lines_ layer to see the result better:

![7.3.2 C]()

8. Open the attribute table of the output layer. It contains three fields, representing the coordinates of the start and end points and the **cost**.

We chose _Shortest_ as **``Path type to calculate``**, so the **cost** represent the **distance**, in layer units, between the two locations.

In our case, the _shortest_ distance between the chosen points is around _1000_ meters:

![7.3.2 D]()

Now that you know how to use the tool, feel free to test other locations.

### 7.3.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Fastest path
With the same data of the previous exercise, try to calculate the fastest path between the two points.

How much time do you need to go from the start to the end point?

[Check your results]()

### 7.3.4. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Advanced options
Let us explore some more options of the Network Analysis tools. In the previous exercise we calculated the **fastest** route between two points. As you can imagine, the time depends on the travel **speed**.

We will use the same layers and starting and ending points of the previous exercises.

1. Open the **``Shortest path (point to point)``** algorithm
2. Fill the **``Input layer``**, **``Start point (x, y)``** and **``End point (x, y)``** as we did before
3. Choose _Fastest_ as the **``Path type to calculate``**
4. Open the **``Advanced parameter``** menu
5. Change the **``Default speed (km/h)``** from the default _50_ value to _4_

![7.3.4 A]()

6. Click on **``Run``**
7. Once the algorithm is finished, close the dialog and open the attribute table of the output layer.

The cost field contains the value according to the speed parameter you have chosen. We can convert the cost field from hours with fractions to the more readable minutes values.

8. Open the field calculator by clicking on the ![calculateField](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionCalculateField.png) icon and add the new field **``minutes``** by multiplying the **``cost``** field by 60:

![7.3.4 B]()

That’s it! Now you know how many minutes it will take to get from one point to the other one.

### 7.3.5. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Service area (from layer)
The **``Network Analysis ‣ Service area (from layer)``** algorithm can answer the question: given a point layer, what are all the reachable areas given a distance or a time value?

**``! Note``**
The **``Network Analysis ‣ Service area (from point)``** is the same algorithm, but it allows you to manually choose the point on the map.

Given a distance of _250_ meters we want to know how far we can go on the network from each point of the **``network_points``** layer.

1. Uncheck all the layers except _network_points_
2. Open the **``Network Analysis ‣ Service area (from layer)``** algorithm
3. Choose _network_lines_ for **``Vector layer representing network``**
4. Choose _network_points_ for **``Vector layer with start points``**
5. Choose _Shortest_ in **``Path type to calculate``**
6. Enter _250_ for the **``Travel cost``** parameter
7. Click on **``Run``** and close the dialog

![7.3.5 A]()

The output layer represents the maximum path you can reach from the point features given a distance of 250 meters:

![7.3.5 B]()

Cool isn’t it?

### 7.3.6. In Conclusion
Now you know how to use **``Network analysis``** algorithm to solve shortest and fastest path problems.

We are now ready to perform some spatial statistic on vector layer data. Let’s go!

### 7.3.7. What’s Next?
Now that we have covered vector analysis, why not see what can be done with rasters? That is what we will do in the next module!

[Next Module: Rasters](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/8.%20Module:%20Rasters.md)
