# 7. Module: Vector Analysis
Now that you have edited a few features, you must want to know what else one can do with them. Having features with attributes is nice, but when all is said and done, this doesn’t really tell you anything that a normal, non-GIS map can’t.

The key advantage of a GIS is this: _a GIS can answer questions_.

For the next three modules, we’ll endeavor to answer a _research question_ using GIS functions. For example, you are an estate agent and you are looking for a residential property in Swellendam for clients who have the following criteria:

1. It needs to be in ~Swellendam~.
2. It must be within reasonable driving distance of a school (say 1km).
3. It must be more than 100m squared in size.
4. Closer than 50m to a main road.
5. Closer than 500m to a restaurant.

Within the next few modules, we’ll harness the power of GIS analysis tools to locate suitable farm properties for this new residential development.

## 7.1. Lesson: Reprojecting and Transforming Data
Let us talk about Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) again. We have touched on this briefly before, but haven’t discussed what it means practically.

**The goal for this lesson:** To reproject and transform vector datasets.

### 7.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Projections
The CRS that all the data, as well as the map itself are in right now is called WGS84. This is a very common Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) for representing data. But there’s a problem, as we will see.

1. Open a new project
2. Then type _world_ in the **``Coordinate``** field, which is in the _Statusbar_ along the bottom of the screen. A **``World Map``** Layer will be added to the empty project.
4. Zoom in to Spain by using the Zoom In tool
5. Try setting a scale in the **``Scale``** field, which is in the _Statusbar_ next to the **``Coordinate``** field the bottom of the screen. While over Spain, set this value to _1:5 000 000_ (one to five million).
6. Pan around the map while keeping an eye on the Scale field

Notice the scale changing? That’s because you are moving away from the one point that you zoomed into at _1:6 000 000_, which was at the center of your screen. All around that point, the scale is different.

To understand why, think about a globe of the Earth. It has lines running along it from North to South. These longitude lines are far apart at the equator, but they meet at the poles.

In a GCS, you are working on this sphere, but your screen is flat. When you try to represent the sphere on a flat surface, distortion occurs, similar to what would happen if you cut open a tennis ball and tried to flatten it out. What this means on a map is that the longitude lines stay equally far apart from each other, even at the poles (where they are supposed to meet). This means that, as you travel away from the equator on your map, the scale of the objects that you see gets larger and larger. What this means for us, practically, is that there is no constant scale on our map!

To solve this, let’s use a Projected Coordinate System (PCS) instead. A PCS “projects” or converts the data in a way that makes allowance for the scale change and corrects it. Therefore, to keep the scale constant, we should reproject our data to use a PCS.

### 7.1.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: “On the Fly” Reprojection
By default, QGIS reprojects data “on the fly”. What this means is that even if the data itself is in another CRS, QGIS can project it as if it were in a CRS of your choice.

You can change the CRS of the project by clicking on the ![projectionEnabled](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mIconProjectionEnabled.png)_Current projection_ button in the bottom right corner of QGIS.

1. In the dialog that appears, type the word _global_ into the **``Filter``** field. A few CRSs should appear in the **``Predefined Reference Systems``** field below.
2. Select EPSG:25830 ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N entry by clicking on it, and then click **``OK``**.
   Notice how the shape of Spain (and the whole world) changes. All projections work by changing the apparent shapes of objects on Earth.
3. Zoom to a scale of _1:6 000 000_ again, as before.
4. Pan around the map.

Notice how the scale stays the same!

“On the fly” reprojection is also used for combining datasets that are in different CRSs.

1. Add another vector layer to your map which has the data for Spain only. You will find it as _exercise_data/world/RSA.shp_.
2. Load it. A quick way to see its CRS is by hovering the mouse over the layer in the legend. It is ~_EPSG:3410_~.
   What do you notice?

The layer is visible even if it has a different CRS from the **``World Map``** one.

### 7.1.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Saving a Dataset to Another CRS
Sometimes you need to export an existing dataset with another CRS. As we will see in the next lesson, if you need to make distance calculations on layer, it is always better to have the layer in a projected coordinate system.

Be aware that the ‘on the fly’ reprojection is related to the **project** and not to single layers. This means that a layer can have a different CRS from the project even if you see it in the correct position.

You can easily export the layer with another CRS.

1. Add the ~_buildings_~ dataset from ~_training_data.gpkg_~
2. Right-click on the ~_buildings_~ layer in the **``Layers``** panel
3. Select **``Export ‣ Save Features As…``** in the menu that appears. You will be shown the **``Save Vector Layer as…``** dialog.
4. Click on the **``Browse``** button next to the **``File name``** field
5. Navigate to _exercise_data/_ and specify the name of the new layer as ~_buildings_reprojected.shp_~.
6. Change the value of the **``CRS``**. Only the recent CRSs used will be shown in the drop-down menu. Click on the ![setProjection](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionSetProjection.png)_Select projection_ button next to the drop-down menu.
7. The **``Coordinate Reference System Selector``** dialog will appear. In its **``Filter``** field, search for ~_30N_~.
8. Select ~**``WGS 84 / UTM zone 34S | EPSG:32734``**~ from the list

![7.1.3 A]()

9. Leave the other options unchanged. The **``Save Vector Layer as…``** dialog now looks like this:

![7.1.3 B]()

10. Click **``OK``**

You can now compare the old and new projections of the layer and see that they are in two different CRS but they are still overlapping.

### 7.1.4. In Conclusion
Different projections are useful for different purposes. By choosing the correct projection, you can ensure that the features on your map are being represented accurately.

### 7.1.6. Further Reading
Materials for the Advanced section of this lesson were taken from [this article](https://anitagraser.com/2012/03/18/beautiful-global-projections-adding-custom-projections-to-qgis/).

Further information on Coordinate Reference Systems is available [here](https://linfiniti.com/dla/worksheets/7_CRS.pdf).

### 7.1.7. What’s Next?
In the next lesson you will learn how to analyze vector data using QGIS’ various vector analysis tools.

## 7.2. Lesson: Vector Analysis
Vector data can also be analyzed to reveal how different features interact with each other in space. There are many different analysis-related functions, so we won’t go through them all. Rather, we will pose a question and try to solve it using the tools that QGIS provides.

**The goal for this lesson:** To ask a question and solve it using analysis tools.

### 7.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The GIS Process
Before we start, it would be useful to give a brief overview of a process that can be used to solve a problem. The way to go about it is:

1. State the Problem
2. Get the Data
3. Analyze the Problem
4. Present the Results

### 7.2.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The Problem
Let’s start off the process by deciding on a problem to solve. For example, you are an ~estate agent~ and you are looking for a ~residential property in Swellendam for clients who have the following criteria~:

~1. It needs to be in Swellendam~
~2. It must be within reasonable driving distance of a school (say 1km)~
~3. It must be more than 100m squared in size~
~4. Closer than 50m to a main road~
~5. Closer than 500m to a restaurant~

### 7.2.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) The Data
To answer these questions, we are going to need the following data:

~1. The residential properties (buildings) in the area~
~2. The roads in and around the town~
~3. The location of schools and restaurants~
~4. The size of buildings~

These data are available through OSM, and you should find that the dataset you have been using throughout this manual also can be used for this lesson.

If you want to download data from another area, jump to the [Introduction Chapter](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/1.%20Course%20Introduction.md) to read how to do it.

**``! Note``**
Although OSM downloads have consistent data fields, the coverage and detail does vary. If you find that your chosen region does not contain information on restaurants, for example, you may need to chose a different region.

### 7.2.4. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Start a Project and get the Data
We first need to load the data to work with.

1. Start a new QGIS project
2. If you want, you can add a background map. Open the **``Browser``** and load the ~**``OSM``**~ background map from the ~**``XYZ Tiles menu.``**~

![7.2.4 A]()

3. In the ~_training_data.gpkg_~ Geopackage database, you will find most the datasets we will use in this chapter:

   1. ~buildings~
   2. roads
   3. ~restaurants~
   4. ~schools~

Load them, and also ~_landuse.sqlite_~.

4. Zoom to the layer extent to see Swellendam, South Africa

Before proceeding we will filter the **``roads layer``**, in order to have only some specific road types to work with.

Some roads in OSM datasets are listed as ~_unclassified_, _tracks_, _path_ and _footway_~. We want to exclude these from our dataset and focus on the other road types, more suitable for this exercise.

Moreover, OSM data might not be updated everywhere, and we will also exclude _NULL_ values.
5. Right click on the _roads_ layer and choose **``Filter…``**.

6. In the dialog that pops up we filter these features with the following expression:

`` "highway" NOT IN ('footway', 'path', 'unclassified', 'track') AND "highway" != NULL`` 

The concatenation of the two operators _NOT_ and _IN_ excludes all the features that have these attribute values in the ~_highway_~ field.

_!= NULL_ combined with the _AND_ operator excludes roads with no value in the ~_highway_~ field.

Note the ![indicatorFilter](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mIndicatorFilter.png) icon next to the roads layer. It helps you remember that this layer has a filter activated, so some features may not be available in the project.

The map with all the data should look like the following one:

![7.2.4 B]()

### 7.2.5. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself Convert Layers’ CRS
Because we are going to be measuring distances within our layers, we need to change the layers’ CRS. To do this, we need to select each layer in turn, save the layer to a new one with our new projection, then import that new layer into our map.

You have many different options, e.g. you can export each layer as an ESRI Shapefile format dataset, you can append the layers to an existing GeoPackage file, or you can create another GeoPackage file and fill it with the new reprojected layers. We will show the last option, so the training_data.gpkg will remain clean. Feel free to choose the best workflow for yourself.

**``! Note``**
In this example, we are using the WGS 84 / UTM zone 34S CRS, but you should use a UTM CRS which is more appropriate for your region.

Right click the roads layer in the Layers panel

Click Export –> Save Features As…

In the Save Vector Layer As dialog choose GeoPackage as Format

Click on … for the File name, and name the new GeoPackage vector_analysis

Change the Layer name to roads_34S

Change the CRS to WGS 84 / UTM zone 34S

Click on OK:

../../../_images/save_roads_34S.png
This will create the new GeoPackage database and add the roads_34S layer.

Repeat this process for each layer, creating a new layer in the vector_analysis.gpkg GeoPackage file with _34S appended to the original name and removing each of the old layers from the project.

Note

When you choose to save a layer to an existing GeoPackage, QGIS will append that layer to the GeoPackage.

Once you have completed the process for all the layers, right click on any layer and click Zoom to layer extent to focus the map to the area of interest.

Now that we have converted OSM data to a UTM projection, we can begin our calculations.

### 7.2.6. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Analyzing the Problem: Distances From Schools and Roads
QGIS allows you to calculate distances between any vector object.

Make sure that only the roads_34S and buildings_34S layers are visible (to simplify the map while you’re working)

Click on the Processing ‣ Toolbox to open the analytical core of QGIS. Basically, all algorithms (for vector and raster analysis) are available in this toolbox.

We start by calculating the area around the roads_34S by using the Buffer algorithm. You can find it in the Vector Geometry group.

../../../_images/processing_buffer_1.png
Or you can type buffer in the search menu in the upper part of the toolbox:

../../../_images/processing_buffer_2.png
Double click on it to open the algorithm dialog

Select roads_34S as Input layer, set Distance to 50 and use the default values for the rest of the parameters.

../../../_images/vector_buffer_setup.png
The default Distance is in meters because our input dataset is in a Projected Coordinate System that uses meter as its basic measurement unit. You can use the combo box to choose other projected units like kilometers, yards, etc.

Note

If you are trying to make a buffer on a layer with a Geographical Coordinate System, Processing will warn you and suggest to reproject the layer to a metric Coordinate System.

By default, Processing creates temporary layers and adds them to the Layers panel. You can also append the result to the GeoPackage database by:

Clicking on the … button and choose Save to GeoPackage…

Naming the new layer roads_buffer_50m

Saving it in the vector_analysis.gpkg file

../../../_images/buffer_saving.png
Click on Run, and then close the Buffer dialog

Now your map will look something like this:

../../../_images/roads_buffer_result.png
If your new layer is at the top of the Layers list, it will probably obscure much of your map, but this gives you all the areas in your region which are within 50m of a road.

Notice that there are distinct areas within your buffer, which correspond to each individual road. To get rid of this problem:

Uncheck the roads_buffer_50m layer and re-create the buffer with Dissolve results enabled.

../../../_images/dissolve_buffer_setup.png
Save the output as roads_buffer_50m_dissolved

Click Run and close the Buffer dialog

Once you have added the layer to the Layers panel, it will look like this:

../../../_images/dissolve_buffer_results.png
Now there are no unnecessary subdivisions.

Note

The Short Help on the right side of the dialog explains how the algorithm works. If you need more information, just click on the Help button in the bottom part to open a more detailed guide of the algorithm.

### 7.2.7. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself Distance from schools
Use the same approach as above and create a buffer for your schools.

It shall to be 1 km in radius. Save the new layer in the vector_analysis.gpkg file as schools_buffer_1km_dissolved.

Check your results

### 7.2.8. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Overlapping Areas
Now we have identified areas where the road is less than 50 meters away and areas where there is a school within 1 km (direct line, not by road). But obviously, we only want the areas where both of these criteria are satisfied. To do that, we will need to use the Intersect tool. You can find it in Vector Overlay group in the Processing Toolbox.

Use the two buffer layers as Input layer and Overlay layer, choose vector_analysis.gpkg GeoPackage in Intersection with Labe name road_school_buffers_intersect. Leave the rest as suggested (default).

../../../_images/school_roads_intersect.png
Click Run.

In the image below, the blue areas are where both of the distance criteria are satisfied.

../../../_images/intersect_result.png
You may remove the two buffer layers and only keep the one that shows where they overlap, since that’s what we really wanted to know in the first place:

../../../_images/final_intersect_result.png
7.2.9. basic Follow Along: Extract the Buildings
Now you’ve got the area that the buildings must overlap. Next, you want to extract the buildings in that area.

Look for the menu entry Vector Selection ‣ Extract by location within the Processing Toolbox

Select buildings_34S in Extract features from. Check intersect in Where the features (geometric predicate), select the buffer intersection layer in By comparing to the features from. Save to the vector_analysis.gpkg, and name the layer well_located_houses.

../../../_images/location_select_dialog.png
Click Run and close the dialog

You will probably find that not much seems to have changed. If so, move the well_located_houses layer to the top of the layers list, then zoom in.

../../../_images/select_zoom_result.png
The red buildings are those which match our criteria, while the buildings in green are those which do not.

Now you have two separated layers and can remove buildings_34S from the layer list.

### 7.2.10. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Further Filter our Buildings
We now have a layer which shows us all the buildings within 1km of a school and within 50m of a road. We now need to reduce that selection to only show buildings which are within 500m of a restaurant.

Using the processes described above, create a new layer called houses_restaurants_500m which further filters your well_located_houses layer to show only those which are within 500m of a restaurant.

[Check your results]

### 7.2.11. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Select Buildings of the Right Size
To see which buildings are of the correct size (more than 100 square meters), we need to calculate their size.

Select the houses_restaurants_500m layer and open the Field Calculator by clicking on the calculateField Open Field Calculator button in the main toolbar or in the attribute table window

Select Create a new field, set the Output field name to AREA, choose Decimal number (real) as Output field type, and choose $area from the Geometry group.

../../../_images/buildings_area_calculator.png
The new field AREA will contain the area of each building in square meters.

Click OK. The AREA field has been added at the end of the attribute table.

Click the toggleEditing Toggle Editing button to finish editing, and save your edits when prompted.

In the Source tab of the layer properties, set the Provider Feature Filter to "AREA >= 100.

../../../_images/buildings_area_query.png
Click OK.

Your map should now only show you those buildings which match our starting criteria and which are more than 100 square meters in size.

### 7.2.12. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
Save your solution as a new layer, using the approach you learned above for doing so. The file should be saved within the same GeoPackage database, with the name solution.

### 7.2.13. In Conclusion
Using the GIS problem solving approach together with QGIS vector analysis tools, you were able to solve a problem with multiple criteria quickly and easily.

### 7.2.14. What’s Next?
In the next lesson, we will look at how to calculate the shortest distance along roads from one point to another.
