# 3. Module: Creating a Basic Map
In this module, you will create a basic map which will be used later as a basis for further demonstrations of QGIS functionality.

## 3.1. Lesson: Working with Vector Data
Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the daily use of GIS. The vector model represents the location and shape of geographic features using points, lines and polygons (and for 3D data also surfaces and volumes), while their other properties are included as attributes (often presented as a table in QGIS). It is usually used to store discrete features, like roads and city blocks. The objects in a vector dataset are called **features**, and contain data that describe their location and properties.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn about the structure of vector data, and how to load vector datasets into a map.

### 3.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Viewing Layer Attributes
It’s important to know that the data you will be working with does not only represent where objects are in space, but also tells you *what* those objects are.

From the previous exercise, you should have the **rivers** layer loaded in your map. The lines that you can see right now are merely the position of the rivers: this is the _spatial data_.

To see all the available data in the **rivers** layer, select it in the Layers panel and click the ![open table](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionOpenTable.png) button.

It will show you a table with more data about the **rivers** layer. This is the layer’s **Attribute table**. A row is called a _record_, and represents a river _feature_. A column is called a _field_, and represents a property of the river. Cells show _attributes_.

**ENTER SCREENSHOT** 3.1.1 A

These definitions are commonly used in GIS, so it’s essential to remember them!
You may now close the attribute table.

### 3.1.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself Exploring Vector Data Attributes
How many fields are available in the **rivers** layer?
Tell us a bit about the _places_ attributes in your dataset.

# **What about next section? Are we creating a GEOPACKAGE?**

### 3.1.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Loading Vector Data From GeoPackage Database
Databases allow you to store a large volume of associated data in one file. You may already be familiar with a database management system (DBMS) such as Libreoffice Base or MS Access. GIS applications can also make use of databases. GIS-specific DBMSes (such as PostGIS) have extra functions, because they need to handle spatial data.
The GeoPackage open format is a container that allows you to store GIS data (layers) in a single file. Unlike the ESRI Shapefile format (e.g. the protected_areas.shp dataset you loaded earlier), a single GeoPackage file can contain various data (both vector and raster data) in different coordinate reference systems, as well as tables without spatial information; all these features allow you to share data easily and avoid file duplication.
In order to load a layer from a GeoPackage, you will first need to create the connection to it:
Click on the  Open Data Source Manager button.
On the left click on the  GeoPackage tab.
Click on the New button and browse to the training_data.gpkg file in the exercise_data folder you downloaded before.
Select the file and press Open. The file path is now added to the Geopackage connections list, and appears in the drop-down menu.
You are now ready to add any layer from this GeoPackage to QGIS.
Click on the Connect button. In the central part of the window you should now see the list of all the layers contained in the GeoPackage file.
Select the roads layer and click on the Add button.

A roads layer is added to the Layers panel with features displayed on the map canvas.
Click on Close.
Congratulations! You have loaded the first layer from a GeoPackage.

### 3.1.4. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Loading Vector Data From a SpatiaLite Database with the Browser
QGIS provides access to many other database formats. Like GeoPackage, the SpatiaLite database format is an extension of the SQLite library. And adding a layer from a SpatiaLite provider follows the same rules as described above: Create the connection –> Enable it –> Add the layer(s).
While this is one way to add SpatiaLite data to your map, let’s explore another powerful way to add data: the Browser.
Click the  icon to open the Data Source Manager window.
Click on the Browser tab.
In this tab you can see all the storage disks connected to your computer as well as entries for most of the tabs in the left. These allow quick access to connected databases or folders.
For example, click on the drop-down icon next to the  GeoPackage entry. You’ll see the training-data.gpkg file we previously connected to (and its layers, if expanded).
Right-click the  SpatiaLite entry and select New Connection….
Navigate to the exercise_data folder, select the landuse.sqlite file and click Open.
Notice that a  landuse.sqlite entry has been added under the SpatiaLite one.
Expand the  landuse.sqlite entry.
Double-click the  landuse layer or select and drag-and-drop it onto the map canvas. A new layer is added to the Layers panel and its features are displayed on the map canvas.

**! Tip**
Enable the Browser panel in View ‣ Panels ‣ and use it to add your data. It’s a handy shortcut for the Data Source Manager ‣ Browser tab, with the same functionality.
Note
Remember to save your project frequently! The project file doesn’t contain any of the data itself, but it remembers which layers you loaded into your map.

### 3.1.5. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself Load More Vector Data
Load the following datasets from the _exercise_data_ folder into your map using any of the methods explained above:
* Places
* Inland water
[Check your results]

### 3.1.6. Follow Along: Reordering the Layers
The layers in your Layers list are drawn on the map in a certain order. The layer at the bottom of the list is drawn first, and the layer at the top is drawn last. By changing the order that they are shown on the list, you can change the order they are drawn in.

**! Note**
You can alter this behavior using the **Control rendering order** checkbox beneath the **Layer Order** panel. We will however not discuss this feature yet.

The order in which the layers have been loaded into the map is probably not logical at this stage. It’s possible that the road layer is completely hidden because other layers are on top of it.
For example, this layer order…

**REPLACE SCREEN SHOT** 3.1.6 A

… would result in roads and places being hidden as they run underneath urban areas.
To resolve this problem:

1. Click and drag on a layer in the Layers list.
2. Reorder them to look like this:

**REPLACE SCREEN SHOT** 3.1.6 B

You’ll see that the map now makes more sense visually, with roads and buildings appearing above the land use regions.

### 3.1.7. In Conclusion
Now you’ve added all the layers you need from several different sources.

### 3.1.8. What’s Next?
Using the random palette automatically assigned when loading the layers, your current map is probably not easy to read. It would be preferable to assign your own choice of colors and symbols. This is what you’ll learn to do in the next lesson.

## 3.2. Lesson: Symbology
The symbology of a layer is its visual appearance on the map. The basic strength of GIS over other ways of representing data with spatial aspects is that with GIS, you have a dynamic visual representation of the data you’re working with.
Therefore, the visual appearance of the map (which depends on the symbology of the individual layers) is very important. The end user of the maps you produce will need to be able to easily see what the map represents. Equally as important, you need to be able to explore the data as you’re working with it, and good symbology helps a lot.
In other words, having proper symbology is not a luxury or just nice to have. In fact, it’s essential for you to use a GIS properly and produce maps and information that people will be able to use.
The goal for this lesson: To be able to create any symbology you want for any vector layer.

### 3.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Changing Colors
To change a layer’s symbology, open its **Layer Properties**. Let’s begin by changing the color of the landuse layer.
Right-click on the landuse layer in the layers list.
Select the menu item Properties… in the menu that appears.
Note
By default, you can also access a layer’s properties by double-clicking on the layer in the Layers list.

**! Tip**
The  button at the top of the Layers panel will open the Layer Styling panel. You can use this panel to change some properties of the layer: by default, changes will be applied immediately!
In the Layer Properties window, select the  Symbology tab:

Click the color select button next to the Color label. A standard color dialog will appear.
Choose a gray color and click OK.
Click OK again in the Layer Properties window, and you will see the color change being applied to the layer.

### 3.2.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
Change the color of the water layer to light blue. Try to use the Layer Styling panel instead of the Layer Properties menu.
[Check your results]

### 3.2.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Changing Symbol Structure
This is good stuff so far, but there’s more to a layer’s symbology than just its color. Next we want to eliminate the lines between the different land use areas so as to make the map less visually cluttered.
Open the Layer Properties window for the landuse layer.
Under the  Symbology tab, you will see the same kind of dialog as before. This time, however, you’re doing more than just quickly changing the color.
In the symbol layers tree, expand the Fill dropdown and select the Simple fill option.
Click on the Stroke style dropdown. At the moment, it should be showing a short line and the words Solid Line.
Change this to No Pen.


Click OK.
Now the landuse layer won’t have any lines between areas.

### 3.2.4. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
Change the water layer’s symbology again so that it has a darker blue outline.
Change the rivers layer’s symbology to a sensible representation of waterways.
Remember: you can use the  Open the Layer Styling panel button and see all the changes instantly. That panel also allows you to undo individual changes while symbolizing a layer.
Check your results

### 3.2.5. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png)  Follow Along: Scale-Based Visibility
Sometimes you will find that a layer is not suitable for a given scale. For example, a dataset of all the continents may have low detail, and not be very accurate at street level. When that happens, you want to be able to hide the dataset at inappropriate scales.
In our case, we may decide to hide the buildings from view at small scales. This map, for example…

… is not very useful. The buildings are hard to distinguish at that scale.
To enable scale-based rendering:
Open the Layer Properties dialog for the buildings layer.
Activate the  Rendering tab.
Enable scale-based rendering by clicking on the checkbox labeled Scale dependent visibility:
Change the Minimum value to 1:10000.

Click OK.
Test the effects of this by zooming in and out in your map, noting when the buildings layer disappears and reappears.
Note
You can use your mouse wheel to zoom in increments. Alternatively, use the zoom tools to zoom to a window:
 
### 3.2.6. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Adding Symbol Layers
Now that you know how to change simple symbology for layers, the next step is to create more complex symbology. QGIS allows you to do this using symbol layers.
Go back to the landuse layer’s symbol properties panel (by clicking Simple fill in the symbol layers tree).
In this example, the current symbol has no outline (i.e., it uses the No Pen border style).

Select the Fill level in the tree and click the  Add symbol layer button. The dialog will change to look something like this, with a new symbol layer added:

It may appear somewhat different in color, for example, but you’re going to change that anyway.
Now there’s a second symbol layer. Being a solid color, it will of course completely hide the previous kind of symbol. Plus, it has a Solid Line border style, which we don’t want. Clearly this symbol has to be changed.
Note
It’s important not to get confused between a map layer and a symbol layer. A map layer is a vector (or raster) that has been loaded into the map. A symbol layer is part of the symbol used to represent a map layer. This course will usually refer to a map layer as just a layer, but a symbol layer will always be called a symbol layer, to prevent confusion.
With the new Simple Fill symbol layer selected:
Set the border style to No Pen, as before.
Change the fill style to something other than Solid or No brush. For example:

Click OK.
Now you can see your results and tweak them as needed. You can even add multiple extra symbol layers and create a kind of texture for your layer that way.

It’s fun! But it probably has too many colors to use in a real map…

### 3.2.7. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png)  Try Yourself
Remembering to zoom in if necessary, create a simple, but not distracting texture for the buildings layer using the methods above.
Check your results

### 3.2.8. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Ordering Symbol Levels
When symbol layers are rendered, they are also rendered in a sequence, similar to the way the different map layers are rendered. This means that in some cases, having many symbol layers in one symbol can cause unexpected results.
Give the roads layer an extra symbol layer (using the method for adding symbol layers demonstrated above).
Give the base line a Stroke width of 1.5 and a black color.
Give the new, uppermost layer a thickness of 0.8 and a white color.
You’ll notice that this happens:

Well, roads have now a street like symbology, but you see that lines are overlapping each others at each cross. That’s not what we want at all!
To prevent this from happening, you can sort the symbol levels and thereby control the order in which the different symbol layers are rendered.
To change the order of the symbol layers:
Select the topmost Line layer in the symbol layers tree.
Click Advanced ‣ Symbol levels… in the bottom right-hand corner of the window.

This will open a dialog like this:

Check  Enable symbol levels. You can then set the layer order of each symbol by entering the corresponding level number. 0 is the bottom layer.
In our case, we just want to activate the option, like this:

This will render the white line above the thick black line borders:
Click OK twice to return to the map.
The map will now look like this:

When you’re done, remember to save the symbol itself so as not to lose your work if you change the symbol again in the future. You can save your current symbol style by clicking the Save Style… button at the bottom of the Layer Properties dialog. We will be using the QGIS QML Style File format.
Save your style in the solution/styles/better_roads.qml folder. You can load a previously saved style at any time by clicking the Load Style… button. Before you change a style, keep in mind that any unsaved style you are replacing will be lost.

### 3.2.9. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself
Change the appearance of the roads layer again.
Make the roads narrow and yellow, with a thin, pale gray outline and a thin black line in the middle. Remember that you may need to change the layer rendering order via the Advanced ‣ Symbol levels… dialog.

### 3.2.10. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Symbol layer types
In addition to setting fill colors and using predefined patterns, you can use different symbol layer types entirely. The only type we’ve been using up to now was the Simple Fill type. The more advanced symbol layer types allow you to customize your symbols even further.
Each type of vector (point, line and polygon) has its own set of symbol layer types. First we will look at the types available for points.

#### 3.2.10.1. Point Symbol Layer Types
Uncheck all the layers except for places.
Change the symbol properties for the places layer:

You can access the various symbol layer types by selecting the Simple marker layer in the symbol layers tree, then click the Symbol layer type dropdown:

Investigate the various options available to you, and choose a symbol with styling you think is appropriate.
If in doubt, use a round Simple marker with a white border and pale green fill, with a Size of 3.00 and a Stroke width of 0.5.

#### 3.2.10.2. Line Symbol Layer Types
To see the various options available for line data:
Change the Symbol layer type for the roads layer’s topmost symbol layer to Marker line:

Select the Simple marker layer in the symbol layers tree. Change the symbol properties to match this dialog:

Select the Marker line layer and change the interval to 1.00:

Ensure that the symbol levels are correct (via the Advanced ‣ Symbol levels dialog we used earlier) before applying the style.
Once you have applied the style, take a look at its results on the map. As you can see, these symbols change direction along with the road but don’t always bend along with it. This is useful for some purposes, but not for others. If you prefer, you can change the symbol layer in question back to the way it was before.

#### 3.2.10.3. Polygon Symbol Layer Types
To see the various options available for polygon data:
Change the Symbol layer type for the water layer, as before for the other layers.
Investigate what the different options on the list can do.
Choose one of them that you find suitable.
If in doubt, use the Point pattern fill with the following options:

Add a new symbol layer with a normal Simple fill.
Make it the same light blue with a darker blue border.
Move it underneath the point pattern symbol layer with the Move down button:

As a result, you have a textured symbol for the water layer, with the added benefit that you can change the size, shape and distance of the individual dots that make up the texture.

### 3.2.11. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself
Apply a green transparent fill color to the protected_areas layer, and change the outline to look like this:

Check your results

### 3.2.12. In Conclusion
Changing the symbology for the different layers has transformed a collection of vector files into a legible map. Not only can you see what’s happening, it’s even nice to look at!

[Examples of Beautiful Maps](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3083/seeking-examples-of-beautiful-maps)

### 3.2.14. What’s Next?
Changing symbols for whole layers is useful, but the information contained within each layer is not yet available to someone reading these maps. What are the streets called? Which administrative regions do certain areas belong to? What are the relative surface areas of the farms? All of this information is still hidden. The next lesson will explain how to represent this data on your map.

**! Note**
Did you remember to save your map recently?
