# 3. Module: Creating a Basic Map
In this module, you will create a basic map which will be used later as a basis for further demonstrations of QGIS functionality.

## 3.1. Lesson: Working with Vector Data
Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the daily use of GIS. The vector model represents the location and shape of geographic features using points, lines and polygons (and for 3D data also surfaces and volumes), while their other properties are included as attributes (often presented as a table in QGIS). It is usually used to store discrete features, like roads and city blocks. The objects in a vector dataset are called **features**, and contain data that describe their location and properties.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn about the structure of vector data, and how to load vector datasets into a map.
