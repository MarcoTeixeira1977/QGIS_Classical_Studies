# 3. Module: Creating a Basic Map
[Exercise data and Additional eductional material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ikwILcqg7wDrZdoxbJqjemp565IeG0j1?ths=true)

In this module, you will create a basic map which will be used later as a basis for further demonstrations of QGIS functionality.

## 3.1. Lesson: Working with Vector Data
Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the daily use of GIS. The vector model represents the location and shape of geographic features using points, lines and polygons (and for 3D data also surfaces and volumes), while their other properties are included as attributes (often presented as a table in QGIS). It is usually used to store discrete features, like roads and city blocks. The objects in a vector dataset are called _features_, and contain data that describe their location and properties.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn about the structure of vector data, and how to load vector datasets into a map.

### 3.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Viewing Layer Attributes
It’s important to know that the data you will be working with does not only represent where objects are in space, but also tells you *what* those objects are.

From the previous Module, you should have the **_L02_BA_Roads.shp_** layer loaded in your map. Or upload the **_L03_BA_Roads.shp_** from the [Exercise data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ikwILcqg7wDrZdoxbJqjemp565IeG0j1?ths=true). The lines that you can see right now are merely the position of the roads: this is the _spatial data_.

To see all the available data in the **_roads_** layer, select it in the Layers panel and click the ![open table](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionOpenTable.png) button.

It will show you a table with more data about the **_roads_** layer. This is the layer’s **Attribute table**. A row is called a _record_, and represents a road _feature_. A column is called a _field_, and represents a property of the road. Cells show _attributes_.

![3.1.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/3.1.1%20A%20attributes%20table.png)

These definitions are commonly used in GIS, so it’s essential to remember them!
You may now close the attribute table.

### 3.1.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself Exploring Vector Data Attributes
How many fields are available in the **_roads_** layer?
Tell us a bit about the _places_ attributes in your dataset.

### 3.1.3. Follow Along: Reordering the Layers
The layers in your Layers list are drawn on the map in a certain order. The layer at the bottom of the list is drawn first, and the layer at the top is drawn last. By changing the order that they are shown on the list, you can change the order they are drawn in.

**! Note**
You can alter this behavior using the **`Control rendering order`** checkbox beneath the **Layer Order** panel. We will however not discuss this feature yet.

The order in which the layers have been loaded into the map is probably not logical at this stage. It’s possible that most layers are completely hidden because other layers are on top of it.
For example, this layer order…

![3.1.3 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/3.1.3%20A%20covered%20layers.png)

… would result in rivers and places being hidden as they run underneath the provincial areas.
To resolve this problem:

1. Click and drag on a layer in the Layers list.
2. Reorder them to look like this:

![3.1.3 B](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/3.1.3%20B%20reordered%20layers.png)

You’ll see that the map now makes more sense visually.

### 3.1.4. In Conclusion
Now you’ve added all the layers you need from several different sources.

### 3.1.5. What’s Next?
Using the random palette automatically assigned when loading the layers, your current map is probably not easy to read. It would be preferable to assign your own choice of colors and symbols. This is what you’ll learn to do in the next lesson.

## 3.2. Lesson: Symbology
The symbology of a layer is its visual appearance on the map. The basic strength of GIS over other ways of representing data with spatial aspects is that with GIS, you have a dynamic visual representation of the data you’re working with.
Therefore, the visual appearance of the map (which depends on the symbology of the individual layers) is very important. The end user of the maps you produce will need to be able to easily see what the map represents. Equally as important, you need to be able to explore the data as you’re working with it, and good symbology helps a lot.
In other words, having proper symbology is not a luxury or just nice to have. In fact, it’s essential for you to use a GIS properly and produce maps and information that people will be able to use.

**The goal for this lesson:** To be able to create any symbology you want for any vector layer.

### 3.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Changing Colors
To change a layer’s symbology, open its **`Layer Properties`**. Let’s begin by changing the color of the **_L03_AWMC_open_waters_** layer. You can find this layer in the exercise data of this module. On how to add the new layers of the module see [2.1.1.](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/2.%20Module:_The_Interface.md#211--follow-along-prepare-a-map)
1. Right-click on the **_L03_AWMC_open_waters_** layer in the layers list.
2. Select the menu item **`Properties…`** in the menu that appears.

**!Note**
By default, you can also access a layer’s properties by double-clicking on the layer in the Layers list.

**!Tip**
The ![Symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png) button at the top of the **Layers** panel will open the **Layer Styling** panel. You can use this panel to change some properties of the layer: by default, changes will be applied immediately!

3. In the **`Layer Properties`** window, select the ![Symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png) **`Symbology`** tab:

![3.2.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/3.2.1%20A%20layer_properties_style.png)

4. Click the color select button next to the **`Color`** label. A standard color dialog will appear.
5. Choose a blue color and click **`OK`**.
6. Click **`OK`** again in the **`Layer Properties`** window, and you will see the color change being applied to the layer.

### 3.2.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
Change the color of the **_provinces_** layer to transparent. Try to use the **`Layer Styling`** panel instead of the **`Layer Properties`** menu.

[Check your results](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Training_Manual/Answer_Sheet/Answer_sheet.md#322-try-it-yourself-colors)

### 3.2.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Changing Symbol Structure
This is good stuff so far, but there’s more to a layer’s symbology than just its color. Next we want to eliminate the lines between the different landuse areas in the **_L03_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora_** layer. This layer can be found in the data for module 3. In later stages we will focuss more on this specific region.
1. Open the **Layer Properties** window for the **_L03_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora_** layer.
Under the ![Symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png) **`Symbology`** tab, you will see the same kind of dialog as before. This time, however, you’re doing more than just quickly changing the color.
2. In the symbol layers tree, expand the **`Fill`** dropdown and select the **`Simple fill`** option.
3. Click on the Stroke style dropdown. At the moment, it should be showing a short line and the words **`Solid Line`**.
4. Change this to **`No Pen`**.

![3.2.2 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/3.2.2%20A%20simple_fill_selected.png)

5. Click **`OK`**.

Now the **_L03_CLC_LanduseAlmanzora_** layer won’t have any lines between areas.

### 3.2.4. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
Change the **_water_** layer’s symbology again so that it has a darker blue outline.
Change the **_rivers_** layer’s symbology to a sensible representation of waterways.
Change the **_province_** layer’s symbology again so that it has a dotted outline.

Remember: you can use the ![Symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png) **`Open the Layer Styling panel`** button and see all the changes instantly. That panel also allows you to undo individual changes while symbolizing a layer.

### 3.2.5. In Conclusion
Changing the symbology for the different layers has transformed a collection of vector files into a legible map. Not only can you see what’s happening, it’s even nice to look at!

[Examples of Beautiful Maps](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3083/seeking-examples-of-beautiful-maps)

### 3.2.7. What’s Next?
Changing symbols for whole layers is useful, but the information contained within each layer is not yet available to someone reading these maps. What are the streets called? Which administrative regions do certain areas belong to? What are the relative surface areas of the farms? All of this information is still hidden. The next lesson will explain how to represent this data on your map.

**! Note**
Did you remember to save your map recently?
