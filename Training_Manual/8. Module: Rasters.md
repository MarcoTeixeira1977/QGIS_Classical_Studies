# 8. Module: Rasters
We’ve used rasters for digitizing before, but raster data can also be used directly. In this module, you’ll see how it’s done in QGIS.

## 8.1. Lesson: Working with Raster Data
Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete features with geometries constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines and/or areas. Raster data, however, is like any image. Although it may portray various properties of objects in the real world, these objects don’t exist as separate objects. Rather, they are represented using pixels with different values.

During this module you are going to use raster data to supplement your existing GIS analysis.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn how to work with raster data in QGIS.

### 8.1.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Loading Raster Data
Raster data can be loaded with the same methods we used for vector data. However we suggest to use the **``Browser``** Panel.

1. Open the **``Browser Panel``** and expand the exercise_data/raster folder.
2. Load all the data in this folder:

> * ~3320C_2010_314_RGB_LATLNG.tif~
> * ~3320D_2010_315_RGB_LATLNG.tif~
> * ~3420B_2010_328_RGB_LATLNG.tif~
> * ~3420C_2010_327_RGB_LATLNG.tif~

You should see the following map:

![8.1.1]() 

There we have it - four aerial images covering our study area.

### 8.1.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Create a Virtual Raster
Now as you can see from this, your solution layer lies across all four images. What this means is that you are going to have to work with four rasters all the time. That’s not ideal. It would be better to have one file to work with.

Luckily, QGIS allows you to do exactly this, and without needing to actually create a new raster file. You can create a **Virtual Raster**. This is also often called a _Catalog_, which explains its function. It’s not really a new raster. Rather, it is a way to organize your existing rasters into one catalog: one file for easy access.

To make a catalog we will use the **``Processing ‣ Toolbox``**.

1. Open the **``Build virtual raster``** algorithm from the **``GDAL ‣ Raster miscellaneous``**;
2. In the dialog that appears, click on the **``…``** button next to the **``Input layers``** parameter and check all the layers or use the **``Select All``** button;
3. Uncheck **``Place each input file into a separate band``**. Notice the text field below. What this dialog is actually doing is that it is writing that text for you. It is a long command that QGIS is going to run.

**``! Note``**
Keep in mind that you can copy and paste the text in the _OSGeo Shell_ (Windows user) or _Terminal_ (Linux and OSX users) to run the command. You can also create a script for each GDAL command. This is very handy when the procedure is taking a long time or when you want to schedule specific tasks. Use the **``Help``** button to get more help on the syntax of the command.

4. Finally click on **``Run``**.

**``! Note``**
As you know from the previous modules, **``Processing``** creates temporary layers by default. To save the file click on the **``…``** button.

![8.1.2]()

You can now remove the original four rasters from the **``Layers``** Panel and leave only the output virtual catalog raster.

#### 8.1.3. In Conclusion
QGIS makes it easy to include raster data into your existing projects.

### 8.1.4. What’s Next?
Next, we’ll use raster data that isn’t aerial imagery, and see how symbolization is useful in the case of rasters as well.


## 8.2. Lesson: Changing Raster Symbology
Not all raster data are aerial photos. There are many other forms of raster data, and in many of those cases, it is essential to symbolize the them so that they becomes properly visible and useful.

The goal for this lesson: To change the symbology for a raster layer.

### 8.2.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Try Yourself
1. Use the **``Browser``** Panel to load ~srtm_41_19.tif~, found under ~exercise_data/raster/SRTM/~
2. Zoom to the extent of this layer by right-clicking on it in the **``Layers panel``** and selecting **``Zoom to Layer``**.

This dataset is a _Digital Elevation Model (DEM)_. It is a map of the elevation (altitude) of the terrain, allowing us to see where the mountains and valleys are, for example.

While each pixel of the dataset of the previous section contained color information, in a DEM, each pixel contains elevation values.

Once the DEM is loaded, you will notice that it is a grayscale representation:

![8.2.1}()

QGIS has automatically applied a stretch to the pixel values og the image for visualization purposes, and we will learn more about how this works as we continue.

### 8.2.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Changing Raster Layer Symbology
You have two different options to change the raster symbology:

1. Within the **``Layer Properties``** dialog, by right-clicking on the layer in the Layer tree and selecting the **``Properties``** option. Then switch to the **``Symbology``** tab
2. By clicking on the ![symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png)_Open the Layer Styling panel_ button right above the **``Layers``** panel (shortcut F7). This will open the **``Layer Styling``** panel, where you can switch to the ![symbology](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbology.png)_Symbology_ tab.

Choose the method you prefer to work with.

### 8.2.3. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Singleband gray
When you load a raster file, if it is not a photo image like the ones of the previous section, the default style is set to a grayscale gradient.

Let’s explore some of the features of this renderer.

![8.2.3 A]()

The default **``Color gradient``** is set to _Black to white_, meaning that low pixel values are black and while high values are white. Try to invert this setting to _White to black_ and see the results.

Very important is the **``Contrast enhancement``** parameter: by default it is set to _Stretch to MinMax_ meaning that the pixel values are stretched to the minimum and maximum values.

Look at the difference with the enhancement (left) and without (right):

![8.2.3 B &C]()

But what are the minimum and maximum values that should be used for the stretch? The ones that are currently under **``Min / Max Value Settings``**. There are many ways to calculate the minimum and maximum values and use them for the stretch:

1. **User Defined**: you enter the **``Min``** and **``Max``** values manually
2. **Cumulative count cut**: this is useful when you have some extreme low or high values. It _cuts_ the _2%_ (or the value you choose) of these values
3. **Min / max**: the _Real_ or _Estimated_ minimum and maximum values of the raster
4. **Mean +/- standard deviation**: the values will be calculated according to the mean value and the standard deviation

### 8.2.4. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Singleband pseudocolor
Grayscales are not always great styles for raster layers. Let’s try to make the DEM more colorful.

* Change the **``Render type``** to **``Singleband pseudocolor``**. If you don’t like the default colors loaded, select another **``Color``** ramp
* Click the **``Classify``** button to generate a new color classification
* If it is not generated automatically click on the **``OK``** button to apply this classification to the DEM

![8.2.4 A]()

You’ll see the raster looking like this:

![8.2.4 B]()

This is an interesting way of looking at the DEM. You will now see that the values of the raster are again properly displayed, going from blue for the lower areas to red for the higher ones.

### 8.2.5. Follow Along: Changing the transparency
Sometimes changing the transparency of the whole raster layer can help you to see other layers covered by the raster itself and better understand the study area.

To change the transparency of the whole raster switch to the **``Transparency``** tab and use the slider of the **``Global Opacity``** to lower the opacity:

![8.2.5 A]()

More interesting is changing the transparency for some pixel values. For example in the raster we used you can see a homogeneous color at the corners. To set these pixels as transparent, go to **``Custom Transparency Options``** in the **``Transparency``** tab.

* By clicking on the ![signPlus](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/symbologyAdd.png)_Add values manually_ button, you can add a range of values and set their transparency percentage
* For single values the ![contextHelp](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionContextHelp.png)_Add values from display_ button is more useful
* Click on the ![contextHelp](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/mActionContextHelp.png)_Add values from display_ button. The dialog disappears, and you can interact with the map.
* Click on on the homogeneous color in a corner of the DEM
* You will see that the transparency table will be filled with the clicked values:

![8.2.5 B]()

Click on **``OK``** to close the dialog and see the changes.


![8.2.5 C]()

See? The corners are now 100% transparent.

### 8.2.6. In Conclusion
These are some the basic functions to get you started with raster symbology. QGIS also gives you many other options, such as symbolizing a layer using paletted/unique values, representing different bands with different colors in a multispectral image, or making an automatic hillshade effect (useful only with DEM raster files).

### 8.2.7. Reference
The SRTM dataset was obtained from http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/

### 8.2.8. What’s Next?
Now that we can see our data displayed properly, let’s investigate how we can analyze it further.

## 8.3. Lesson: Terrain Analysis
Certain types of rasters allow you to gain more insight into the terrain that they represent. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are particularly useful in this regard. In this lesson you will use terrain analysis tools to find out more about the study area for the proposed residential development from earlier.

**The goal for this lesson**: To use terrain analysis tools to derive more information about the terrain.

### 8.3.1. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Calculating a Hillshade
We are going to use the same DEM layer as in the previous lesson. If you are starting this chapter from scratch, use the **``Browser``** panel and load the _~raster/SRTM/srtm_41_19.tif~_.

The DEM layer shows you the elevation of the terrain, but it can sometimes seem a little abstract. It contains all the 3D information about the terrain that you need, but it doesn’t look like a 3D object. To get a better impression of the terrain, it is possible to calculate a _hillshade_, which is a raster that maps the terrain using light and shadow to create a 3D-looking image.

We are going to use algorithms in the **``Raster ‣ Raster terrain analysis``** menu.

1. Click on the **``Hillshade``** menu
2. The algorithm allows you to specify the position of the light source: Azimuth has values from 0 (North) through 90 (East), 180 (South) and 270 (West), while the Vertical angle sets how high the light source is (0 to 90 degrees). We will use the default values:

![8.3.1 A](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Screenshots/8.3.1%20A%20hillshade_explanation.png)

3. Save the file in a new folder _raster_analysis_ within the folder _exercise_data/8.Module_ with the name _hillshade_
4. Finally click on **``Run``**

You will now have a new layer called **``hillshade``** that looks like this:

![8.3.1 B]()

That looks nice and 3D, but can we improve on this? On its own, the hillshade looks like a plaster cast. Can’t we use it together with our other, more colorful rasters somehow? Of course we can, by using the hillshade as an overlay.

### 8.3.2. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Using a Hillshade as an Overlay
A hillshade can provide very useful information about the sunlight at a given time of day. But it can also be used for aesthetic purposes, to make the map look better. The key to this is setting the hillshade to being mostly transparent.

1. Change the symbology of the original ~**``srtm_41_19``**~ layer to use the **``Pseudocolor``** scheme as in the previous exercise
2. Hide all the layers except the ~**``srtm_41_19``**~  and **``hillshade``** layers
3. Click and drag the ~**``srtm_41_19``**~  to be beneath the **``hillshade``** layer in the **``Layers``** panel
4. Set the **``hillshade``** layer to be transparent by clicking on the **``Transparency``** tab in the layer properties
5. Set the **``Global opacity``** to _50%_.

You’ll get a result like this:

![8.3.2 A]()

6. Switch the **``hillshade``** layer off and back on in the **``Layers``** panel to see the difference it makes.

Using a hillshade in this way, it’s possible to enhance the topography of the landscape. If the effect doesn’t seem strong enough to you, you can change the transparency of the **``hillshade``** layer; but of course, the brighter the hillshade becomes, the dimmer the colors behind it will be. You will need to find a balance that works for you.

Remember to save the project when you are done.

### 8.3.3. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Calculating the Slope
Another useful thing to know about the terrain is how steep it is. If, for example, you want to build houses on the land there, then you need land that is relatively flat.

To do this, you need to use the **``Slope``** algorithm of the **``Processing ‣ Raster terrain analysis``**.

1. Open the algorithm
2. Choose ~**``srtm_41_19``**~ as the **``Elevation layer``**
3. Save the output as a file with the name _slope_ in the same folder as the _hillshade_
4. Click on **``Run``**

Now you’ll see the slope of the terrain, with black pixels being flat terrain and white pixels, steep terrain:

![8.3.3 A]()

### 8.3.4. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Using the Raster Calculator
Think back to the estate agent problem, which we last addressed in the Vector Analysis lesson. Let us imagine that the buyers now wish to purchase a building and build a smaller cottage on the property. In the Southern Hemisphere, we know that an ideal plot for development needs to have areas on it that are north-facing, and with a slope of less than five degrees. But if the slope is less than 2 degrees, then the aspect doesn’t matter.

Fortunately, you already have rasters showing you the slope as well as the aspect, but you have no way of knowing where both conditions are satisfied at once. How could this analysis be done?

The answer lies with the Raster calculator.

QGIS has different raster calculators available:

Raster ‣ Raster Calculator

In processing:

Raster Analysis ‣ Raster calculator

GDAL ‣ Raster miscellaneous ‣ Raster calculator

SAGA ‣ Raster calculus ‣ Raster calculator

Each tool is leading to the same results, but the syntax may be slightly different and the availability of operators may vary.

We will use Raster Analysis ‣ Raster calculator in the Processing Toolbox

Open the tool by double clicking on it.

The upper left part of the dialog lists all the loaded raster layers as name@N, where name is the name of the layer and N is the band.

In the upper right part you will see a lot of different operators. Stop for a moment to think that a raster is an image. You should see it as a 2D matrix filled with numbers.

North is at 0 (zero) degrees, so for the terrain to face north, its aspect needs to be greater than 270 degrees and less than 90 degrees. Therefore the formula is:

aspect@1 <= 90 OR aspect@1 >= 270
Now you have to set up the raster details, like the cell size, extent and CRS. This can be done manually or it can be automatically set by choosing a Reference layer. Choose this last option by clicking on the … button next to the Reference layer(s) parameter.

In the dialog, choose the aspect layer, because we want to obtain a layer with the same resolution.

Save the layer as aspect_north.

The dialog should look like:

../../../_images/raster_calculator.png
Finally click on Run.

Your result will be this:

../../../_images/aspect_result.png
The output values are 0 or 1. What does it mean? The formula we wrote contains the conditional operator OR. Therefore the final result will be False (0) and True (1).

### 8.3.5. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Try Yourself More criteria
Now that you have done the aspect, create two new layers from the DEM.

The first shall identify areas where the slope is less than or equal to 2 degrees

The second is similar, but the slope should be less than or equal to 5 degrees.

Save them under exercise_data/raster_analysis as slope_lte2.tif and slope_lte5.tif.

Check your results

### 8.3.6. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Combining Raster Analysis Results
Now you have generated three raster layers from the DEM:

aspect_north: terrain facing north

slope_lte2: slope equal to or below 2 degrees

slope_lte5: slope equal to or below 5 degrees

Where the conditions are met, the pixel value is 1. Elsewhere, it is 0. Therefore, if you multiply these rasters, the pixels that have a value of 1 for all of them will get a value of 1 (the rest will get 0).

The conditions to be met are:

at or below 5 degrees of slope, the terrain must face north

at or below 2 degrees of slope, the direction that the terrain faces does not matter.

Therefore, you need to find areas where the slope is at or below five degrees AND the terrain is facing north, OR the slope is at or below 2 degrees. Such terrain would be suitable for development.

To calculate the areas that satisfy these criteria:

Open the Raster calculator again

Use this expression in Expression:

( aspect_north@1 = 1 AND slope_lte5@1 = 1 ) OR slope_lte2@1 = 1
Set the Reference layer(s) parameter to aspect_north (it does not matter if you choose another - they have all been calculated from srtm_41_19)

Save the output under exercise_data/raster_analysis/ as all_conditions.tif

Click Run

The result:

../../../_images/development_analysis_results.png

### 8.3.7. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Simplifying the Raster
As you can see from the image above, the combined analysis has left us with many, very small areas where the conditions are met. But these aren’t really useful for our analysis, since they are too small to build anything on. Let us get rid of all these tiny unusable areas.

Open the Sieve tool (GDAL ‣ Raster Analysis in the Processing Toolbox)

Set the Input file to all_conditions, and the Sieved to all_conditions_sieve.tif (under exercise_data/raster_analysis/).

Set the Threshold to 8 (minimum eight contiguous pixels), and check Use 8-connectedness.

../../../_images/raster_seive_dialog.png
Once processing is done, the new layer will be loaded.

../../../_images/seive_result_incorrect.png
What is going on? The answer lies in the new raster file’s metadata.

View the metadata under the Information tab of the Layer Properties dialog. Look the STATISTICS_MINIMUM value:

../../../_images/seive_metadata.png
This raster, like the one it is derived from, should only feature the values 1 and 0, but it has also a very large negative number. Investigation of the data shows that this number acts as a null value. Since we are only after areas that weren’t filtered out, let us set these null values to zero.

Open the Raster Calculator, and build this expression:

(all_conditions_sieve@1 <= 0) = 0
This will maintain all non-negative values, and set the negative numbers to zero, leaving all the areas with value 1 intact.

Save the output under exercise_data/raster_analysis/ as all_conditions_simple.tif.

Your output looks like this:

../../../_images/raster_seive_correct.png
This is what was expected: a simplified version of the earlier results. Remember that if the results you get from a tool aren’t what you expected, viewing the metadata (and vector attributes, if applicable) can prove essential to solving the problem.

### 8.3.8. ![moderate](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/moderate.png) Follow Along: Reclassifying the Raster
We have used the Raster calculator to do calculations on raster layers. There is another powerful tool that we can use to extract information from existing layers.

Back to the aspect layer. We know now that it has numerical values within a range from 0 through 360. What we want to do is to reclassify this layer to other discrete values (from 1 to 4), depending on the aspect:

1 = North (from 0 to 45 and from 315 to 360);

2 = East (from 45 to 135)

3 = South (from 135 to 225)

4 = West (from 225 to 315)

This operation can be achieved with the raster calculator, but the formula would become very very large.

The alternative tool is the Reclassify by table tool in Raster analysis in the Processing Toolbox.

Open the tool

Choose aspect as the Input raster layer

Click on the … of Reclassification table. A table-like dialog will pop up, where you can choose the minimum, maximum and new values for each class.

Click on the Add row button and add 5 rows. Fill in each row as the following picture and click OK:

../../../_images/reclassify_table.png
The method used by the algorithm to treat the threshold values of each class is defined by the Range boundaries.

Save the layer as file:reclassified.tif in the exercise_data/raster_analysis/ folder

../../../_images/reclassify_setup.png
Click on Run

If you compare the native aspect layer with the reclassified one, there are not big differences. But by looking at the legend, you can see that the values go from 1 to 4.

Let us give this layer a better style.

Open the Layer Styling panel

Choose Paletted/Unique values, instead of Singleband gray

Click on the Classify button to automatically fetch the values and assign them random colors:

../../../_images/unique_style.png
The output should look like this (you can have different colors given that they have been randomly generated):

../../../_images/reclassify_result.png
With this reclassification and the paletted style applied to the layer, you can immediately differentiate the aspect areas.

### 8.3.9. ![basic](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/AutumnSchool_2020/blob/master/Icons/basic.png) Follow Along: Querying the raster
Unlike vector layers, raster layers don’t have an attribute table. Each pixel contains one or more numerical values (singleband or multiband rasters).

All the raster layers we used in this exercise consist of just one band. Depending on the layer, pixel values may represent elevation, aspect or slope values.

How can we query the raster layer to get the value of a pixel? We can use the identify Identify Features button!

Select the tool from the Attributes toolbar.

Click on a random location of the srtm_41_19 layer. Identify Results will appear with the value of the band at the clicked location:

../../../_images/identify_raster.png
You can change the output of the Identify Results panel from the current tree mode to a table one by selecting Table in the View menu at the bottom of the panel:

../../../_images/identify_raster_table.png
Clicking each pixel to get the value of the raster could become annoying after a while. We can use the Value Tool plugin to solve this problem.

Go to Plugins ‣ Manage/Install Plugins…

In the All tab, type value t in the search box

Select the Value Tool plugin, press Install Plugin and then Close the dialog.

../../../_images/value_tool.png
The new Value Tool panel will appear.

**``! Tip``**
If you close the panel you can reopen it by enabling it in the View ‣ Panels ‣ Value Tool or by clicking on the icon in the toolbar.

To use the plugin just check the Enable checkbox and be sure that the srtm_41_19 layer is active (checked) in the Layers panel.

Move the cursor over the map to see the value of the pixels.

../../../_images/value_tool_query.png
But there is more. The Value Tool plugin allows you to query all the active raster layers in the Layers panel. Set the aspect and slope layers active again and hover the mouse on the map:

../../../_images/value_tool_query_multi.png

### 8.3.10. In Conclusion
You’ve seen how to derive all kinds of analysis products from a DEM. These include hillshade, slope and aspect calculations. You’ve also seen how to use the raster calculator to further analyze and combine these results. Finally you learned how to reclassify a layer and how to query the results.

### 8.3.11. What’s Next?
Now you have two analyses: the vector analysis which shows you the potentially suitable plots, and the raster analysis that shows you the potentially suitable terrain. How can these be combined to arrive at a final result for this problem? That’s the topic for the next lesson, starting in the next module.
