### 3.1.2 Try Yourself Exploring Vector Data Attributes
There should be **XXX** fields in the rivers layer:

1. Select the **layer** in the Layers panel.
2. Right-click and choose **Open Attribute Table**, or press the openTable button on the **Attributes Toolbar**.
3. Count the number of columns.

**!Tip**

A quicker approach could be to double-click the rivers layer, open the Layer properties ‣ Fields tab, where you will find a numbered list of the table’s fields.

Information about places is available in the **places layer**. Open its attribute table as you did with the **rivers** layer: there are **XX** features whose **place** attribute is set to **XXX**: **XXX** and **XXX**. You can add comment on other fields from these two records, if you like.
